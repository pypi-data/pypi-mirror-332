"""Tests for the Dissipation module in YAQS.

This module provides tests for verifying the correctness of dissipation processes
applied to Matrix Product States (MPS) via the `apply_dissipation` method.

The tests ensure:
- Dissipation correctly modifies the canonical form of MPS, specifically shifting
the orthogonality center as expected.
- Correct behavior when applying simple noise models (e.g., relaxation processes)
with given strengths and small time steps.

These tests validate the functionality and correctness of dissipation handling
in quantum simulations performed using the YAQS framework.
