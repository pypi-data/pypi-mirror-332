class BloomFilter(Predicate, Serializable):
    """
    A Bloom filter for instances of `T`. A Bloom filter offers an approximate containment test
    with one-sided error: if it claims that an element is contained in it, this might be in error,
    but if it claims that an element is *not* contained in it, then this is definitely True.
    
    If you are unfamiliar with Bloom filters, this nice <a
    href="http://llimllib.github.io/bloomfilter-tutorial/">tutorial</a> may help you understand how
    they work.
    
    The False positive probability (`FPP`) of a Bloom filter is defined as the probability
    that .mightContain(Object) will erroneously return `True` for an object that
    has not actually been put in the `BloomFilter`.
    
    Bloom filters are serializable. They also support a more compact serial representation via the
    .writeTo and .readFrom methods. Both serialized forms will continue to be
    supported by future versions of this library. However, serial forms generated by newer versions
    of the code may not be readable by older versions of the code (e.g., a serialized Bloom filter
    generated today may *not* be readable by a binary that was compiled 6 months ago).
    
    As of Guava 23.0, this class is thread-safe and lock-free. It internally uses atomics and
    compare-and-swap to ensure correctness when multiple threads are used to access it.
    
    Type `<T>`: the type of instances that the `BloomFilter` accepts
