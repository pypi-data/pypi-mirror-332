    Represents an event triggered when a new cursor is created by a SculkCatalyst.
    
    <strong>Cursor Definition:</strong>
    A cursor in this context is a dynamic marker or pointer generated by the
    SculkCatalyst. It occupies a block and spreads sculk as it moves. It is
    similar to entity, but it is not an entity. Cursors are ticked by the
    tile entity.
    
    <strong>Triggers for Cursor Creation:</strong>
    
      - An entity, when killed and drops experience, within an 8-block radius of a SculkCatalyst.
      - An explicit call from a plugin using SculkCatalyst.bloom(Block, int).
    
    
    The result of .getBlock() is the location that the cursor is spawning at.

        Sets the charge of the cursor.
        
        Increasing the charge of a cursor makes the cursor last longer, giving
        it more time to spread sculk blocks across a larger range.
        
        Typically, charges should be set to the exp reward of a mob
        (EntityDeathEvent.getDroppedExp()), which is usually
        3-5 for animals, and 5-10 for the average mob (up to 50 for
        wither skeletons). Roughly speaking, for each charge, 1 more
        sculk block will be placed.

        Arguments
        - charge: the charge of the cursor.
