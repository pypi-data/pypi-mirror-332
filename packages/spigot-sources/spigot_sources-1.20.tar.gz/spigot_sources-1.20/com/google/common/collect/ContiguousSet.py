class ContiguousSet(ImmutableSortedSet):
    """
    A sorted set of contiguous values in a given DiscreteDomain. Example:
    
    ````ContiguousSet.create(Range.closed(5, 42), DiscreteDomain.integers())````
    
    Note that because bounded ranges over `int` and `long` values are so common, this
    particular example can be written as just:
    
    ````ContiguousSet.closed(5, 42)````
    
    **Warning:** Be extremely careful what you do with conceptually large instances (such as
    `ContiguousSet.create(Range.greaterThan(0), DiscreteDomain.integers()`). Certain operations
    on such a set can be performed efficiently, but others (such as Set.hashCode or Collections.frequency) can cause major performance problems.
