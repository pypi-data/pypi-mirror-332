    Low-level, high-performance utility methods related to the Charsets.UTF_8 UTF-8
    character encoding. UTF-8 is defined in section D92 of <a
    href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.2.0/ch03.pdf">The Unicode Standard Core
    Specification, Chapter 3</a>.
    
    The variant of UTF-8 implemented by this class is the restricted definition of UTF-8
    introduced in Unicode 3.1. One implication of this is that it rejects <a
    href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum1.html">"non-shortest form"</a> byte sequences,
    even though the JDK decoder may accept them.

        Returns the number of bytes in the UTF-8-encoded form of `sequence`. For a string, this

        Returns `True` if `bytes` is a *well-formed* UTF-8 byte sequence according to
        Unicode 6.0. Note that this is a stronger criterion than simply whether the bytes can be
        decoded. For example, some versions of the JDK decoder will accept "non-shortest form" byte
        sequences, but encoding never reproduces these. Such byte sequences are *not* considered
        well-formed.
        
        This method returns `True` if and only if `Arrays.equals(bytes, new
