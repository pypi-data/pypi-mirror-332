class RangeSet:
    """
    A set comprising zero or more Range.isEmpty nonempty, Range.isConnected(Range) disconnected ranges of type `C`.
    
    Implementations that choose to support the .add(Range) operation are required to
    ignore empty ranges and coalesce connected ranges. For example:
    
    ````RangeSet<Integer> rangeSet = TreeRangeSet.create();
    rangeSet.add(Range.closed(1, 10)); // {[1, 10]`
    rangeSet.add(Range.closedOpen(11, 15)); // disconnected range; {[1, 10], [11, 15)}
    rangeSet.add(Range.closedOpen(15, 20)); // connected range; {[1, 10], [11, 20)}
    rangeSet.add(Range.openClosed(0, 0)); // empty range; {[1, 10], [11, 20)}
    rangeSet.remove(Range.open(5, 10)); // splits [1, 10]; {[1, 5], [10, 10], [11, 20)}
    }```
    
    Note that the behavior of Range.isEmpty() and Range.isConnected(Range) may not
    be as expected on discrete ranges. See the Javadoc of those methods for details.
    
    For a Set whose contents are specified by a Range, see ContiguousSet.
