    A stack of many Matrix4d instances. This resembles the matrix stack known from legacy OpenGL.
    
    This Matrix4dStack class inherits from Matrix4d, so the current/top matrix is always the Matrix4dStack/Matrix4d itself. This
    affects all operations in Matrix4d that take another Matrix4d as parameter. If a Matrix4dStack is used as argument to those methods,
    the effective argument will always be the *current* matrix of the matrix stack.
