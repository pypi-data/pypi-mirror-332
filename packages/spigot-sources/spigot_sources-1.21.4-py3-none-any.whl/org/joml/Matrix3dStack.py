    A stack of many Matrix3d instances. This resembles the matrix stack known from legacy OpenGL.
    
    This Matrix3dStack class inherits from Matrix3d, so the current/top matrix is always the
    Matrix3dStack/Matrix3d itself. This affects all operations in Matrix3d that take another
    Matrix3d as parameter. If a Matrix3dStack is used as argument to those methods, the effective
    argument will always be the *current* matrix of the matrix stack.
