    A dummy superclass to support GWT serialization of the element type of a Range. The GWT
    supersource for this class contains a field of type `C`.
    
    For details about this hack, see `GwtSerializationDependencies`, which takes the same
    approach but with a subclass rather than a superclass.
    
    TODO(cpovirk): Consider applying this subclass approach to our other types.
