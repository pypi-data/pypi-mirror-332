    A dummy superclass to support GWT serialization of the element types of a LinkedHashMultimap. The GWT supersource for this class contains a field for each type.
    
    For details about this hack, see `GwtSerializationDependencies`, which takes the same
    approach but with a subclass rather than a superclass.
    
    TODO(cpovirk): Consider applying this subclass approach to our other types.
