    A mapping from disjoint nonempty ranges to non-null values. Queries look up the value
    associated with the range (if any) that contains a specified key.
    
    In contrast to RangeSet, no "coalescing" is done of Range.isConnected(Range) connected ranges, even if they are mapped to the same value.
