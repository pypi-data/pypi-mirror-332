# damast: Creation of reproducible data processing pipelines

Documentation at: https://simula.github.io/damast

## Installation and Development Setup

Firstly, you will want to create you an isolated development environment for Python, that being conda or venv-based.
The following will go through a venv based setup.

Let us assume you operate with a 'workspace' directory for this project:

```
    cd workspace
```

Here, you will create a virtual environment.
Get an overview over venv (command):

```
    python -m venv --help
```

Create your venv and activate it:
```
    python -m venv damast-venv
    source damast-venv/bin/activate
```

Clone the repo and install:

```
    git clone https://github.com/simula/damast
    cd damast
    pip install -e ".[test,dev]"

```

## Docker Container

If you prefer to work or start with a docker container you can build it using the provided [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)
```
    docker build -t damast:latest -f Dockerfile .
```

To enter the container:
```
    docker run -it --rm damast:latest /bin/bash
```

## Usage

Once you installed the package you can locally generate the documentation:
```
    tox -e build_docs
```
You can then open the documentation with a browser:
```
    <yourbrowser> _build/html/index.html
```

Otherwise you will find API and usage documentation [here](https://simula-srl.gitlab.io/damast/README.html).




## Testing

Install the project and use the predefined default test environment:

    tox -e py
