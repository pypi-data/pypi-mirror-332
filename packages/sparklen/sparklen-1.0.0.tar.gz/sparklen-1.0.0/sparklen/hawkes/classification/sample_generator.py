    """
    Generate a random `K`-class classification problem.
    
    This function generates data consisting of labeled repeated realizations of Hawkes processes.  
    
    A :math:`d`-dimensional Hawkes process, denoted :math:`N = (N_1, \dots, N_d)` 
    is given by :math:`d` point processes on :math:`\mathbb{R}_+^*`, with 
    :math:`d \geq 1` the dimension of the network.
    
    Each process :math:`N_j` is characterized by its intensity function, which 
    depends on :math:`Y` and is given by:
    
    .. math::
        \\mu_{Y,j} + \\sum_{j'=1}^d \\alpha_{Y,j,j'} \\int_0^t 
        \\beta e^{-\\beta(t-s)} \ \\textrm{d} N_{j'}(s)
                                                 
    where
        
    * :math:`(\\mu_{k,j})_{j \\in [d]}` is the vector of exogenous intensities of class `k`
    * :math:`(\\alpha_{k, j, j'})_{j, j' \\in [d]}` is the matrix of interactions of class `k`
    * :math:`\\beta` is the fixed and given decay of the exponential kernel
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    bold_mu : ndarray of shape (K, d, )
        Exogenous intensities of each class. For each class `k`, `mu[k][j]` 
        expresses the arrival of spontaneous events for the `j`-th process.
        
    bold_alpha : ndarray of shape (K, d, d)
        Interaction matrix of the process. For each class `k`, `alpha[k][j][j']` 
        reflects the positive influence of the `j'`-th one-dimensional process 
        on the `j`-th one-dimensional process. 
        
    beta : float
        Common decay scalar of the process. Dictates how quick the influences 
        vanish over time.
        
    end_time : float
        The end time of the observation period. The time horizon defines
        the interval `[0, T]` over which the Hawkes process is observed.
        
    n_samples : int
        The total number of repeated paths generated in the simulation.  
        
    n_classes : int
        The number of classes (or labels) of the classification problem.
        
    weights : ndarray of shape (K,), default=None
        The proportions of samples assigned to each class. 
        If `weights=None`, then classes are balanced.
        
    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines random number generation for dataset creation. 
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.

    Returns
    -------
    X : list of list of ndarray
        The generated samples. The outer list has length `n`, 
        representing repetitions. Each inner list has length `d`, where 
        each element is a one-dimensional ndarray containing the 
        event times of a specific component. 
    y : ndarray of shape (n,)
        The integer labels for class membership of each sample.
