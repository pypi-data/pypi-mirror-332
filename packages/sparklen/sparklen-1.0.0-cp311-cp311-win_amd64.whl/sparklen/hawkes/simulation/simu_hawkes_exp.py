class SimuHawkesExp():
    """
    Simulation class for Hawkes process with exponential kernel. 
    
    This class generates data consisting of repeated realizations of a Hawkes process.  
    
    The event simulation is based on the cluster representation of the process.
    
    A :math:`d`-dimensional Hawkes process, denoted :math:`N = (N_1, \dots, N_d)` 
    is given by :math:`d` point processes on :math:`\mathbb{R}_+^*`, with 
    :math:`d \geq 1` the dimension of the network.
    
    Each process :math:`N_j` is characterized by its intensity function 
    :math:`\\lambda_j(t)`:
        
    .. math::    
        \\mu_j + \\sum_{j'=1}^d  \\alpha_{j,j'} \\sum_{\\ell : t_{j',\\ell} < t} 
        \\beta e^{-\\beta(t-t_{j',\\ell})}
    
    where
       
    * :math:`(\\mu_j)_{j \\in [d]}` is the vector of exogenous intensities
    * :math:`(\\alpha_{j, j'})_{j, j' \\in [d]}` is the matrix of interactions
    * :math:`\\beta` is the fixed and given decay of the exponential kernel
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    mu : ndarray of shape (d, )
        Exogenous intensitie of the process. Each `mu[j]` expresses the arrival 
        of spontaneous events for the `j`-th process.
        
    alpha : ndarray of shape (d, d)
        Interaction matrix of the process. Each `alpha[j][j']` reflects the 
        positive influence of the `j'`-th one-dimensional process on the `j`-th
        one-dimensional process. 
        
    beta : float
        Common decay scalar of the process. Dictates how quick the influences 
        vanish over time.
        
    end_time : float
        The end time of the observation period. The time horizon defines
        the interval `[0, T]` over which the Hawkes process is observed.
        
    n_samples : int
        The total number of repeated paths generated in the simulation.  
        
    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines random number generation for dataset creation. 
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    timestamps : list of list of ndarray
        The generated event timestamps. The outer list has length `n`, 
        representing repetitions. Each inner list has length `d`, where 
        each element is a one-dimensional ndarray containing the 
        event times of a specific component. This property can be modified.
    
    Notes
    ----------
    This class handle the simulation of univariate Hawkes processes, as these 
    are naturally included as a special case of the multivariate model.
