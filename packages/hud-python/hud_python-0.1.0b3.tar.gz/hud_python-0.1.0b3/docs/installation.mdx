# Installation

You can install the HUD SDK using pip:

```bash
# Install the latest stable release
pip install hud-python

# Install the latest alpha release (may include breaking changes)
pip install --pre hud-python

# Install a specific alpha version
pip install hud-python==0.1.0
```

## Alpha Release Status

> **Note**: HUD is currently in alpha status (v0.1.0-alpha). The API is still evolving and may include breaking changes in future releases. Please provide feedback on GitHub if you encounter any issues.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- An API key from Human Union Data

## Environment Setup

The SDK uses environment variables for configuration. You can set these in your environment or in a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# .env file
HUD_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HUD_API_KEY` | Your HUD API key | Yes |

## Development Installation

If you want to contribute to the SDK or install it in development mode:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/humanuniondata/hud-python.git
cd hud-python

# Create a virtual environment (using venv)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Or using uv (recommended)
uv venv
# Activate according to your shell

# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Verification

To verify your installation, try running a simple example:

```python
import hud

# Print the version number
print(f"HUD SDK version: {hud.__version__}")
```

You should see the version number of the installed SDK without any errors.
