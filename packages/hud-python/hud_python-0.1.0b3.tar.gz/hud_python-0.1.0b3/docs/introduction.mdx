# HUD SDK (Alpha Release)

A Python SDK for interacting with HUD environments and evaluation benchmarks for browser use and computer use models.

> **Alpha Release Notice**: This SDK is currently in alpha status (v0.1.0-alpha). The API is still evolving and may change in future releases as we gather feedback and improve functionality.

[Visit our homepage â†’](https://hud.so)

## Overview

HUD provides a powerful interface for:

- Connecting to Human Union Data evaluation environments
- Running benchmarks across various tasks
- Supporting different agent adapters
- Providing an asynchronous API for efficient interactions

## Key Features

- **Environment Connection**: Connect to HUD evaluation environments seamlessly
- **Benchmarking**: Run standardized benchmarks across a variety of tasks
- **Adapter System**: Support for different agent adapters including Claude
- **Asynchronous API**: Efficient asynchronous interface for all operations

## Get Started

Follow our [Installation Guide](/installation) to get set up, then check out the [Quickstart Guide](/quickstart) to run your first example.

```python
import asyncio
from hud import HUDClient
from hud.settings import settings

async def main():
    # Initialize client with API key from settings
    client = HUDClient(api_key=settings.api_key)
    
    # Load gym and evalset
    gym = await client.load_gym(id="OSWorld-Ubuntu")
    evalset = await client.load_evalset(id="OSWorld-Ubuntu")
    
    # Create a run
    run = await client.create_run(name="example-run", gym=gym, evalset=evalset)
    
    # And more...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
