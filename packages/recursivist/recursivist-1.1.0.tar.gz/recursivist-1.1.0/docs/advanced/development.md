# Development Guide

This guide provides information for developers who want to contribute to or extend Recursivist.

## Setting Up Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git
- pip (Python package manager)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArmaanjeetSandhu/recursivist.git
cd recursivist
```

### Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Development Dependencies

```bash
# Install the package in development mode with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This installs Recursivist in "editable" mode, so your changes to the source code will be reflected immediately without reinstalling.

## Project Structure

Recursivist is organized into several modules:

- `cli.py`: Command-line interface using Typer
- `core.py`: Core functionality for directory traversal and structure building
- `exports.py`: Functionality for exporting directory structures
- `compare.py`: Functionality for comparing directory structures
- `jsx_export.py`: Specialized functionality for React component export

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes to the codebase.

3. Run the tests to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

4. Add and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add your meaningful commit message here"
   ```

5. Push your changes to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. Create a pull request on GitHub.

### Code Style

Recursivist follows PEP 8 style guidelines. We recommend using the following tools for code formatting and linting:

- **Black** for code formatting:

  ```bash
  black recursivist tests
  ```

- **Flake8** for code linting:

  ```bash
  flake8 recursivist tests
  ```

- **MyPy** for type checking:
  ```bash
  mypy recursivist
  ```

## Adding a New Feature

### Adding a New Command

To add a new command to the CLI:

1. Open `cli.py`
2. Add your new command using the Typer decorator pattern:

```python
@app.command()
def your_command(
    directory: Path = typer.Argument(
        ".", help="Directory path to process"
    ),
    # Add more parameters as needed
):
    """
    Your command description.

    Detailed information about what the command does and how to use it.
    """
    # Implement your command logic here
    pass
```

3. Implement the core functionality in the appropriate module.
4. Add tests for your new command.

### Adding a New Export Format

To add a new export format:

1. Open `exports.py`
2. Add a new method to the `DirectoryExporter` class:

```python
def to_your_format(self, output_path: str) -> None:
    """Export directory structure to your format.

    Args:
        output_path: Path where the export file will be saved
    """
    # Implement export to your format
    try:
        # Your export logic here
        with open(output_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            # Write your formatted output
            pass
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error exporting to YOUR_FORMAT: {e}")
        raise
```

3. Update the `export_structure` function in `core.py` to support your new format.
4. Add tests for your new export format.

## Testing

### Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
pytest
```

To run specific test files:

```bash
pytest tests/test_core.py
```

To generate a coverage report:

```bash
pytest --cov=recursivist --cov-report=html
```

This creates an HTML coverage report in the `htmlcov` directory.

### Writing Tests

Test files are located in the `tests` directory. We use pytest for testing.

When writing tests, follow these guidelines:

1. Structure your tests with clear, descriptive names.
2. Test both normal and edge case behaviors.
3. Use fixtures and parametrization where appropriate.
4. Mock external dependencies when necessary.

Example test:

```python
def test_get_directory_structure_with_exclude_dirs(tmp_path):
    # Setup
    root_dir = tmp_path / "root"
    root_dir.mkdir()
    (root_dir / "include_dir").mkdir()
    (root_dir / "exclude_dir").mkdir()
    (root_dir / "include_dir" / "file.txt").write_text("content")
    (root_dir / "exclude_dir" / "file.txt").write_text("content")

    # Execute
    structure, _ = get_directory_structure(
        str(root_dir), exclude_dirs=["exclude_dir"]
    )

    # Assert
    assert "include_dir" in structure
    assert "exclude_dir" not in structure
    assert "_files" in structure["include_dir"]
    assert "file.txt" in structure["include_dir"]["_files"]
```

## Building and Distribution

### Building the Package

To build the package:

```bash
# Install build tools if not already installed
pip install build

# Build the package
python -m build
```

This creates distribution packages in the `dist` directory.

### Running the CLI During Development

While developing, you can run the CLI directly:

```bash
# Using Python
python -m recursivist.cli visualize

# Using the installed development version
recursivist visualize
```

## Debugging

### Verbose Output

Use the `--verbose` flag to enable detailed logging:

```bash
recursivist visualize --verbose
```

This provides more information about what's happening during execution, which can be helpful for debugging.

### Debugging Specific Modules

You can set up logging for specific modules to get more detailed information:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger('recursivist.core')
```

### Using a Debugger

For more complex issues, you can use a debugger like `pdb` or an IDE debugger:

```python
import pdb
pdb.set_trace()  # Add this line at the point where you want to start debugging
```

## Documentation

### Docstrings

Use Google-style docstrings for all functions, classes, and methods:

```python
def function_name(param1: Type1, param2: Type2) -> ReturnType:
    """Short description of the function.

    More detailed description if needed.

    Args:
        param1: Description of param1
        param2: Description of param2

    Returns:
        Description of return value

    Raises:
        ExceptionType: When and why this exception is raised
    """
    # Function implementation
```

### Command-Line Help

Update the command-line help text when you add or modify commands or options:

```python
@app.command()
def your_command(
    param: str = typer.Option(
        None, "--param", "-p", help="Clear description of the parameter"
    )
):
    """
    Clear, concise description of what the command does.

    More detailed explanation with examples:

    Examples:
        recursivist your_command --param value
    """
    # Implementation
```

## Performance Considerations

### Large Directory Structures

When working with large directory structures:

1. Use generators and iterators where possible to minimize memory usage.
2. Implement early filtering to reduce the number of files and directories processed.
3. Consider adding progress indicators for long-running operations.
4. Test with large directories to ensure acceptable performance.

### Profiling

Use the `cProfile` module to profile performance:

```python
import cProfile
cProfile.run('your_function_call()', 'profile_results')

# To analyze the results
import pstats
p = pstats.Stats('profile_results')
p.sort_stats('cumulative').print_stats(20)
```

## Extending Recursivist

### Adding Support for New Pattern Types

To add a new pattern matching type:

1. Update the `should_exclude` function in `core.py`.
2. Add appropriate command-line options in `cli.py`.
3. Add documentation for the new pattern type.
4. Add tests for the new functionality.

### Adding New Visualization Features

To enhance the visualization:

1. Modify the `build_tree` and `display_tree` functions in `core.py`.
2. Ensure the visualization works well in different terminal environments.
3. Update documentation and tests.

## Release Process

### Version Numbering

Recursivist follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for backwards-compatible feature additions
- **PATCH** version for backwards-compatible bug fixes

### Creating a Release

1. Update the version in `__init__.py`.
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md file.
3. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for release x.y.z"
   ```
4. Create a tag for the release:
   ```bash
   git tag -a vx.y.z -m "Release x.y.z"
   ```
5. Push the changes and tag:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   git push origin vx.y.z
   ```
6. Build the package:
   ```bash
   python -m build
   ```
7. Upload to PyPI:
   ```bash
   twine upload dist/*
   ```
