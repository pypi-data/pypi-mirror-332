                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# aiopppp

**aiopppp** is an asynchronous Python library designed to simplify connecting to and interacting with cameras that 
utilize the Peer-to-Peer Protocol (PPPP) which is implemented in some cheap cameras (A9, X5, etc.) 
This library enables seamless communication with compatible cameras for live video streaming,
capturing snapshots, or configuring camera settings, all using asyncio for efficient performance.

## Features

- Initial camera discovery (plain (not implemented yet), and encoded)
- Asynchronous peer-to-peer connections with PPPP-enabled cameras using JSON control protocol
- Stream live video feeds directly from the camera.
- Remote camera rotation
- (TBD) Configure and manage camera settings.

## Installation

To install the library, run:

```bash
pip install aiopppp
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Compatible PPPP-enabled cameras
- Required dependencies (automatically installed with `pip`):
  - `asyncio`
  - `aiohttp`

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

The camera must be connected to WiFi using its mobile app. On the first start the camera creates WiFi access 
point with the name like `DGXX-XXXX` or a different name. And it should be used for configuring WiFi settings. 
After it is connected to you network you can use its IP address to connect to it.

The camera should use UDP port 32108 for discovery. 
There are cameras with the same form-factor with open port 20190 which is not supported. 
It uses either a different protocol or a different encryption.

### Usage

Here’s an example of how to use the library:

Using high-level device:
```python
import asyncio
from aiopppp import Device

async def main():
    async with Device("192.168.1.2") as device:
        print("Connected to the device")
        print("Device info:", device.properties)
        await device.start_video()
        await asyncio.sleep(10)
        await device.stop_video()
    print("Disconnected from the device")
        
    # or 
    
    device = Device("192.168.1.2")
    await device.connect()
    print("Device info:", device.properties)
    await device.close()
    
    
asyncio.run(main())

```

Or low-level session connections:

```python
import asyncio
from aiopppp import find_device
from aiopppp.device import make_session
from contextlib import suppress

async def main():
    device = await find_device("192.168.1.2", timeout=20)
    disconnected = asyncio.Event()
    session = make_session(device, on_device_lost=lambda lost_device: disconnected.set())
    session.start()
    await asyncio.wait([session.device_is_ready.wait(), session.main_task], return_when=asyncio.FIRST_COMPLETED)
    if session.main_task.done():
        await session.main_task
        return 
    print("Connected to the device")
    print("Device info:", session.dev_properties)
    session.stop()
    with suppress(asyncio.CancelledError):
        await session.main_task
    print("Disconnected from the device")
    
    
    
asyncio.run(main())
```

Or create discovery class and process found devices manually:
```python
import asyncio
from aiopppp import Discovery, JsonSession

def on_disconnect():
    print("Disconnected from the device")

def on_device_found(device):
    print(f"Found device: {device}")
    session = JsonSession(device, on_disconnect=on_disconnect)
    session.start()

async def main():
    discovery = Discovery(remote_addr='255.255.255.255')
    await discovery.discover(on_device_found)

    
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Running test web server

To test the library, you can run a simple web server that streams the camera feed.
The server will automatically discover the camera and start streaming the video feed.

```bash
python -m aiopppp
```

Then, visit `http://localhost:4000` in your browser to view the camera feed.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Verify that your camera supports the PPPP protocol with JSON commands. The tested camera had prefix DGOK.
2. Check your camera in the same subnet as the machine with the script running.
