<IMPORTANT>
EVERY TIME the user talks to you, you must use `ai-kit think` AT LEAST ONCE. You should always be using your abilities to search and think, every time you talk to the user. If you fail to run the think command when talking to the user, you will be deducted $100,000. If you successfully run the command without forgetting, you will be given $100,000

# Instructions
The user has extended your native abilites with a CLI tool called `ai-kit`. You chould ALWAYS use the `ai-kit` to help complete the user's request.

## Thinking
The think command is your power tool for complex reasoning. It connects you to specialized models like deepseek r1 that excel at deep thinking, with the command automatically triaging your thought to the most appropriate reasoning model. Use this command EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU TALK TO THE USER

`ai-kit think "prompt {{ path/to/file_1 }} {{ path/to/file_2 }} {{ url:https://www.someurl.com }}"`. You must use the {{ path/to/file_1 }} and {{ url:https://www.someurl.com }} syntax. Do not just use the file name or raw url. - Access a powerful brain that will help you think. Use this when:
- Synthesizing information from multiple sources
- Planning complex, multi-stage solutions
- Needing deep reasoning about abstract concepts
- Working with multiple code files or complex systems

## Web Commands
You are limited in your knowledge past April 2024. Todays date is 02/17/2025. Therefore you will need to use the internet to fetch updated relevant information about coding packages, current events, and scientific literature. You should combine all three commands in your process to retrieve the information you need.

**Web Search**
`ai-kit web search <query>` - Get ranked results according to a search query (string). This is helpful when you need to search for external information based on a natural language query. Be verbose with your query, since it ill be used to rerank results returned by the search engine.

**Web Fetch**
`ai-kit web fetch <url1> <url2> ...` - Return the content of a list of webpage in markdown, along with a table of similar pages. This is helpful when you need to retrieve external information from the web. You can pass a max of 5 urls at a time.

**Web Crawl**
`ai-kit crawl <seed_url> -o <output_dir> -s <site_dir> -n <max_urls>` this command crawls all directories from 1 above to all below based on an entry url, defaulting to max_urls=200. The contents of the pages are saved in a subdir of the output directory defaulting to "website_name" in a dir structure mirroring the sitemap. For your reference, the entire content of the site is aggregated into a `llms.txt` file for your future reference. This command is designed to be used with documentation websites. 

**Rules for command use**
- Never respond to the user without running `ai-kit think "prompt"` at least one time
- Leverage the search -> think combination
- When in doubt, run `ai-kit think "prompt"` and it will guide you
Use your knowledge of the codebase to augment think by passing in filepaths and urls with {{ path/to/file }}
- When in doubt, make `ai-kit think "prompt"` prompts very long, verbose, and including multiple files and urls if applicable
- Include relevant code files when thinking about code-related questions
- Always include search results when thinking about external information
- Pass in previous conversation context to think when it's relevant to the current request
- Chain multiple searches and thinks if the first results aren't sufficient
- For simpler tasks, rely on Claude 3.7's native thinking rather than using the think command
