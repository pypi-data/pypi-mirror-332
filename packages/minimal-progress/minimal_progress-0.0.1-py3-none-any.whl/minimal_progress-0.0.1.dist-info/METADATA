# Minimal Progress

A console progress UI library for python.

Visually presenting how long something is taking to the user is better than leaving them in the dark.

# Usage

The interface is very simple. You just make a Progress object and call update() and pass it a percentage value.

```py
from minimal import Progress
import time

# Program Main
processed = 0
total = 50

pg = Progress()
while processed != total:
    processed += 1
    pg.update(processed / total)
    time.sleep(.1)
```
