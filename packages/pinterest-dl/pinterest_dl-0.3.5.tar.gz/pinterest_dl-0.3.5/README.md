This library facilitates the scraping and downloading of images from [Pinterest](https://pinterest.com). Using [Selenium](https://selenium.dev) and reverse engineered Pinterest API for automation, it enables users to extract images from a specified Pinterest URL and save them to a chosen directory.

It includes a [CLI](#-cli-usage) for direct usage and a [Python API](#️-python-api) for programmatic access. The tool supports scraping images from public and private boards and pins using browser cookies. It also allows users to save scraped URLs to a JSON file for future access.

> [!TIP]
> If you are looking for a GUI version of this tool, check out [pinterest-dl-gui](https://github.com/sean1832/pinterest-dl-gui).
> It provides a user-friendly interface for scraping and downloading images from Pinterest using the same underlying library. It could also serve as a reference for integrating the library into your own GUI application.

### Examples

**Scraping Images in anonymous mode:**

Scrape images in anonymous mode, without login, to the `./images/art` directory from the Pinterest URL `https://www.pinterest.com/pin/1234567` with a limit of `30` images and a minimum resolution of `512x512`. Save scraped URLs to a `JSON` file.
```bash
pinterest-dl scrape "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/1234567" "images/art" -l 30 -r 512x512 --json
```

**Get Browser Cookies:**

Get browser cookies for Pinterest login and save them to the `cookies.json` file in headful mode (with browser window).
```bash
pinterest-dl login -o cookies.json --headful
```
> [!TIP]
> You will be prompted to enter your Pinterest email and password. The tool will save the browser cookies to the specified file for future use.

**Scraping Private Boards:**

Scrape images from a private Pinterest board using the cookies saved in the `cookies.json` file.
```bash
pinterest-dl scrape "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/1234567" "images/art" -l 30 -c cookies.json
```

> [!TIP]
> You can use the `--client` option to use `chrome` or `firefox` Webdriver for scraping. This is slower but more reliable.
> It will open a browser in headless mode to scrape images. You can also use the `--headful` flag to run the browser in windowed mode.

**Downloading Images:**

Download images from the `art.json` file to the `./downloaded_imgs` directory with a minimum resolution of `1024x1024`.
```bash
pinterest-dl download art.json -o downloaded_imgs -r 1024x1024
```

## 🛠️ Python API
You can also use the `PinterestDL` class directly in your Python code to scrape and download images programmatically.

### 1. Quick Scrape and Download
This example shows how to **scrape** and download images from a Pinterest URL in one step.

```python
from pinterest_dl import PinterestDL

# Initialize and run the Pinterest image downloader with specified settings
images = PinterestDL.with_api(
    timeout=3,  # Timeout in seconds for each request (default: 3)
    verbose=False,  # Enable detailed logging for debugging (default: False)
).scrape_and_download(
    url="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/1234567",  # Pinterest URL to scrape
    output_dir="images/art",  # Directory to save downloaded images
    limit=30,  # Max number of images to download 
    min_resolution=(512, 512),  # Minimum resolution for images (width, height) (default: None)
    json_output="art.json",  # File to save URLs of scraped images (default: None)
    dry_run=False,  # If True, performs a scrape without downloading images (default: False)
    add_captions=True,  # Adds image `alt` text as metadata to images (default: False)
)
```

This example shows how to **search** with query and download images from a Pinterest URL in one step.

```python
from pinterest_dl import PinterestDL

# Initialize and run the Pinterest image downloader with specified settings
# `search_and_download` is only available in API mode
images = PinterestDL.with_api( 
    timeout=3,  # Timeout in seconds for each request (default: 3)
    verbose=False,  # Enable detailed logging for debugging (default: False)
).search_and_download(
    query="art",  # Pinterest search query
    output_dir="images/art",  # Directory to save downloaded images
    limit=30,  # Max number of images to download 
    min_resolution=(512, 512),  # Minimum resolution for images (width, height) (default: None)
    json_output="art.json",  # File to save URLs of scraped images (default: None)
    dry_run=False,  # If True, performs a scrape without downloading images (default: False)
    add_captions=True,  # Adds image `alt` text as metadata to images (default: False)
)
```

### 2. Scrape with Cookies for Private Boards
**2a. Obtain cookies**
You need to first log in to Pinterest to obtain browser cookies for scraping private boards and pins.
```python
import os
import json

from pinterest_dl import PinterestDL

# Make sure you don't expose your password in the code.
email = input("Enter Pinterest email: ")
password = os.getenv("PINTEREST_PASSWORD")

# Initialize browser and login to Pinterest
cookies = PinterestDL.with_browser(
    browser_type="chrome",
    headless=True,
).login(email, password).get_cookies(
    after_sec=7,  # Time to wait before capturing cookies. Login may take time.
)

# Save cookies to a file
with open("cookies.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(cookies, f, indent=4)
```

**2b. Scrape with cookies**
After obtaining cookies, you can use them to scrape private boards and pins.
```python
import json
from pinterest_dl import PinterestDL

# Load cookies from a file
with open("cookies.json", "r") as f:
    cookies = json.load(f)

# Initialize and run the Pinterest image downloader with specified settings
images = (
    PinterestDL.with_api()
    .with_cookies(
        cookies,  # cookies in selenium format
    )
    .scrape_and_download(
        url="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/1234567",  # Assume this is a private board URL
        output_dir="images/art",  # Directory to save downloaded images
        limit=30,  # Max number of images to download
    )
)
```

### 3. Detailed Scraping with Lower-Level Control

Use this example if you need more granular control over scraping and downloading images.

#### 3a. With API

##### Scrape Images
```python
import json

from pinterest_dl import PinterestDL

# 1. Initialize PinterestDL with API.
scraped_images = PinterestDL.with_api().scrape(
    url="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/1234567",  # URL of the Pinterest page
    limit=30,  # Maximum number of images to scrape
    min_resolution=(512, 512),  # <- Only available to set in the API. Browser mode will have to pruned after download.
)

# 2. Save Scraped Data to JSON
# Convert scraped data into a dictionary and save it to a JSON file for future access
images_data = [img.to_dict() for img in scraped_images]
with open("art.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(images_data, f, indent=4)

# 3. Download Images
# Download images to a specified directory
downloaded_imgs = PinterestDL.download_images(images=scraped_images, output_dir="images/art")

valid_indices = list(range(len(downloaded_imgs)))  # All images are valid to add captions

# 4. Add Alt Text as Metadata
# Extract `alt` text from images and set it as metadata in the downloaded files
PinterestDL.add_captions(images=downloaded_imgs, indices=valid_indices)
```

##### Search Images
```python
import json
from pinterest_dl import PinterestDL

# 1. Initialize PinterestDL with API.
scraped_images = PinterestDL.with_api().search(
    query="art",  # Search query for Pinterest
    limit=30,  # Maximum number of images to scrape
    min_resolution=(512, 512),  # Minimum resolution for images
    delay=0.4, # Delay between requests (default: 0.2)
)
# ... (Same as above)
```

#### 3b. With Browser
```python
import json

from pinterest_dl import PinterestDL

# 1. Initialize PinterestDL with API.
scraped_images = PinterestDL.with_browser(
    browser_type="chrome",  # Browser type to use ('chrome' or 'firefox')
    headless=True,  # Run browser in headless mode
).scrape(
    url="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/1234567",  # URL of the Pinterest page
    limit=30,  # Maximum number of images to scrape
)

# 2. Save Scraped Data to JSON
# Convert scraped data into a dictionary and save it to a JSON file for future access
images_data = [img.to_dict() for img in scraped_images]
with open("art.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(images_data, f, indent=4)

# 3. Download Images
# Download images to a specified directory
downloaded_imgs = PinterestDL.download_images(images=scraped_images, output_dir="images/art")

# 4. Prune Images by Resolution
# Remove images that do not meet the minimum resolution criteria
valid_indices = PinterestDL.prune_images(images=downloaded_imgs, min_resolution=(200, 200))

# 5. Add Alt Text as Metadata
# Extract `alt` text from images and set it as metadata in the downloaded files
PinterestDL.add_captions(images=downloaded_imgs, indices=valid_indices)
```
