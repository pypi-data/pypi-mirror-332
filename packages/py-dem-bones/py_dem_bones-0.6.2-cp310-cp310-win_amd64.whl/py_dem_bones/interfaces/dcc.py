"""
DCC software integration interface for py-dem-bones.

This module defines an abstract interface that can be implemented by third-party
developers to integrate py-dem-bones with various digital content creation (DCC)
software such as Maya, Blender, or custom 3D applications.

    Abstract base class for DCC software integration.

        Apply coordinate system transformations.

        This is a utility method to handle coordinate system differences
        between DCC software and DemBones. The base implementation is a
        no-op that returns the data unchanged. Subclasses should override
        this method if the DCC software uses a different coordinate system.

            data: The data to transform
            from_dcc (bool): If True, transform from DCC to DemBones coordinate system,
