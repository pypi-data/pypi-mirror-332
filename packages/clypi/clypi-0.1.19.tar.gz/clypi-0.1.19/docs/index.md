## Align

### `align`

```python
def align(s: str, alignment: AlignType, width: int) -> str
```
Aligns text according to `alignment` and `width`. In contrast with the built-in
methods `rjust`, `ljust`, and `center`, `clypi.align(...)` aligns text according
to it's true visible width (the built-in methods count color codes as width chars).

Parameters:
- `s`: the string being aligned
- `alignment`: one of `left`, `right`, or `center`
- `width`: the wished final visible widht of the string

Examples:

> ```python
> clypi.align("foo", "left", 10) -> "foo       "
> clypi.align("foo", "right", 10) -> "          foo"
> clypi.align("foo", "center", 10) -> "   foo   "
>```


## Boxed

### `Boxes`

```python
class Boxes(Enum): ...
```

The border style you'd like to use. To see all the box styles in action run `uv run -m examples.boxed`.

The full list can be found in the code [here](https://github.com/danimelchor/clypi/blob/master/clypi/_data/boxes.py).


### `boxed`

```python
def boxed(
    lines: T,
    width: int | None = None,
    style: Boxes = Boxes.HEAVY,
    alignment: AlignType = "left",
    title: str | None = None,
    color: ColorType = "bright_white",
) -> T:
```
Wraps text neatly in a box with the selected style, padding, and alignment.

Parameters:
- `lines`: the type of lines will determine it's output type. It can be one of `str`, `list[str]` or `Iterable[str]`
- `width`: the desired width of the box
- `style`: the desired style (see [`Boxes`](#Boxes))
- `alignment`: the style of alignment (see [`align`](#align))
- `title`: optionally define a title for the box, it's lenght must be < width
- `color`: a color for the box border and title (see [`colors`](#colors))

Examples:

> ```python
> print(clypi.boxed("Some boxed text", color="red", width=30, align="center"))
> ```

## CLI

### `config`

```python
def config(
    parser: Parser[T] | None = None,
    default: T | Unset = _UNSET,
    default_factory: t.Callable[[], T] | Unset = _UNSET,
    help: str | None = None,
    short: str | None = None,
    prompt: str | None = None,
    hide_input: bool = False,
    max_attempts: int = MAX_ATTEMPTS,
) -> T
```

Utility function to configure how a specific argument should behave when displayed
and parsed.

Parameters:
- `parser`: a function that takes in a string and returns the parsed type (see [`Parser`](#parser[t]))
- `default`: the default value to return if the user doesn't pass in the argument (or hits enter during the prompt, if any)
- `default_factory`: a function that returns a default value. Useful to defer computation or to avoid default mutable values
- `help`: a brief description to show the user when they pass in `-h` or `--help`
- `short`: for options it defines a short way to pass in a value (e.g.: `short="v"` allows users to pass in `-v <value>`)
- `prompt`: if defined, it will ask the user to provide input if not already defined in the command line args
- `hide_input`: whether the input shouldn't be displayed as the user types (for passwords, API keys, etc.)
- `max_attempts`: how many times to ask the user before giving up and raising

### `Command`

This is the main class you must extend when defining a command. There are no methods you must override
other than the [`run`](#run) method. The type hints you annotate the class will define the arguments that
command will take based on a set of rules:

#### Subcommands

To define a subcommand, you must define a field in a class extending `Command` called `subcommand`. It's type hint must
point to other classes extending `Command` or `None` by using either a single class, or a union of classes.

These are all valid examples:
```python
from clypi import Command

class MySubcommand(Command):
    pass

class MyOtherSubcommand(Command):
    pass

class MyCommand(Command):
    # A mandatory subcommand `my-subcommand`
    subcommand: MySubcommand

    # An optional subcommand `my-subcommand`
    subcommand: MySubcommand | None

    # A mandatory subcommand `my-subcommand` or `my-other-subcommand`
    subcommand: MySubcommand | MyOtherSubcommand

    # An optional subcommand `my-subcommand` or `my-other-subcommand`
    subcommand: MySubcommand | MyOtherSubcommand | None
```

#### Flags

Flags are boolean options that can be either present or not. To define a flag, simply define
a boolean class attribute in your command with a default value. The user will then be able
to pass in `--my-flag` when running the command which will set it to True.

```python
from clypi import Command

# With the flag ON: my-command --my-flag
# With the flag OFF: my-command
class MyCommand(Command):
    my_flag: bool = False
```

#### Options

Options are like flags but, instead of booleans, the user passes in values that can be ommitted. As
the name indicates, you just have to define an optional attribute in your class with a default value.
```python
from clypi import Command

# With value: my-command --my-attr foo
# With default: my-command
class MyCommand(Command):
    my_attr: str | int = "some-default-here"
```

#### Arguments (positional)

Arguments are mandatory positional words the user must pass in. They're defined as class attributes with
no default. Arguments are collected in the order they're mentioned, so you'll need to keep that in mind.

```python
from clypi import Command

# my-command 5 foo bar baz
#        arg1^ ^^^^^^^^^^^arg2
class MyCommand(Command):
    arg1: int
    arg2: list[str]
```

#### Running the command

You must implement the [`run`](#run) method so that your command can be ran. The function
must be `async` so that we can properly render items in your screen.

```python
from clypi import Command, config

class MyCommand(Command):
    verbose: bool = False

    async def run(self):
        print(f"Running with verbose: {self.verbose}")
```

#### Help page

You can define custom help messages for each argument using our handy `config` helper:

```python
from clypi import Command, config

class MyCommand(Command):
    verbose: bool = config(help="Whether to show all of the output", default=True)
```

You can also define custom help messages for commands by creating a docstring on the class itself:
```python
from clypi import Command, config

class MyCommand(Command):
    """
    This text will show up when someone does `my-command --help`
    and can contain any info you'd like
    """
```

#### Prompting

If you want to ask the user to provide input if it's not specified, you can pass in a prompt to `config` for each field like so:

```python
from clypi import Command, config

class MyCommand(Command):
    name: str = config(prompt="What's your name?")
```

On runtime, if the user didn't provide a value for `--name`, the program will ask the user to provide one until they do. You can also pass in a `default` value to `config` to allow the user to just hit enter to accept the default.

#### Custom parsers

If the type you want to parse from the user is too complex, you can define your own parser
using `config` as well:

```python
import typing as t
from clypi import Command, config

def parse_slack(value: t.Any) -> str:
    if not value.startswith('#'):
        raise ValueError("Invalid Slack channel. It must start with a '#'.")
    return value

class MyCommand(Command):
    slack: str = config(parser=parse_slack)
```

Optionally, you can use packages like [v6e](https://github.com/danimelchor/v6e) to parse the input:

```python
import v6e
from clypi import Command, config

class MyCli(Command):
    files: list[Path] = config(parser=v6e.path().exists().list())
```

#### Forwarding arguments

If a command defines an argument you want to use in any of it's children, you can re-define the
argument and pass in a literal ellipsis (`...`) to config to indicate the argument comes from the
parent command. You can also use `forwarded=True` if you prefer:

```python
from clypi import Command, config

class MySubCmd(Command):
    verbose: bool = config(...)  # or `config(forwarded=True)`

class MyCli(Command):
    subcommand: MySubCmd | None
```

#### Autocomplete

All CLIs built with clypi come with a builtin `--install-autocomplete` option that will automatically
set up shell completions for your built CLI.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is brand new and might contain some bugs. Please file a ticket
> if you run into any!

#### `prog`
```python
@t.final
@classmethod
def prog(cls)
```
The name of the command. Can be overriden to provide a custom name
or will default to the class name extending `Command`.

#### `help`
```python
@t.final
@classmethod
def help(cls)
```
The help displayed for the command when the user passes in `-h` or `--help`. Defaults to the
docstring for the class extending `Command`.

#### `run`
```python
async def run(self: Command) -> None:
```
The main function you **must** override. This function is where the business logic of your command
should live.

`self` contains the arguments for this command you can access
as you would do with any other instance property.


#### `astart` and `start`
```python
async def astart(self: Command | None = None) -> None:
```
```python
def start(self) -> None:
```
These commands are the entry point for your program. You can either call `YourCommand.start()` on your class
or, if already in an async loop, `await YourCommand.astart()`.


#### `print_help`
```python
@t.final
@classmethod
def print_help(cls, parents: list[str] = [], *, exception: Exception | None = None)
```
Prints the help page for a particular command.

Parameters:
- `parents`: a list of parent commands. Passed automatically during runtime if an error occurs or the user tries to access the help page.
- `exception`: an exception neatly showed to the user as a traceback. Automatically passed in during runtime.

## Colors

### `ColorType`

```python
ColorType: t.TypeAlias = t.Literal[
    "black",
    "red",
    "green",
    "yellow",
    "blue",
    "magenta",
    "cyan",
    "white",
    "default",
    "bright_black",
    "bright_red",
    "bright_green",
    "bright_yellow",
    "bright_blue",
    "bright_magenta",
    "bright_cyan",
    "bright_white",
    "bright_default",
]
```

### `styler`
```python
def styler(
    fg: ColorType | None = None,
    bg: ColorType | None = None,
    bold: bool = False,
    italic: bool = False,
    dim: bool = False,
    underline: bool = False,
    blink: bool = False,
    reverse: bool = False,
    strikethrough: bool = False,
    reset: bool = False,
) -> Styler
```
Returns a reusable function to style text.

Examples:
> ```python
> wrong = clypi.styler(fg="red", strikethrough=True)
> print("The old version said", wrong("Pluto was a planet"))
> print("The old version said", wrong("the Earth was flat"))
> ```

### `style`
```python
def style(
    *messages: t.Any,
    fg: ColorType | None = None,
    bg: ColorType | None = None,
    bold: bool = False,
    italic: bool = False,
    dim: bool = False,
    underline: bool = False,
    blink: bool = False,
    reverse: bool = False,
    strikethrough: bool = False,
    reset: bool = False,
) -> str
```
Styles text and returns the styled string.

Examples:
> ```python
> print(clypi.style("This is blue", fg="blue"), "and", clypi.style("this is red", fg="red"))
> ```

### `print`

```python
def print(
    *messages: t.Any,
    fg: ColorType | None = None,
    bg: ColorType | None = None,
    bold: bool = False,
    italic: bool = False,
    dim: bool = False,
    underline: bool = False,
    blink: bool = False,
    reverse: bool = False,
    strikethrough: bool = False,
    reset: bool = False,
    end: str | None = "\n",
) -> None
```
Styles and prints text directly.

Examples:
> ```python
> clypi.print("Some colorful text", fg="green", reverse=True, bold=True, italic=True)
> ```

## Prompts

### `Parser[T]`

```python
Parser: TypeAlias = Callable[[Any], T] | type[T]
```
A function taking in any value and returns a value of type `T`. This parser
can be a user defined function, a built-in type like `str`, `int`, etc., or a parser
from a library.

### `prompt`

```python
def prompt(
    text: str,
    default: T | Unset = _UNSET,
    parser: Parser[T] = str,
    hide_input: bool = False,
    max_attempts: int = MAX_ATTEMPTS,
) -> T:
```
Prompts the user for a value and uses the provided parser to validate and parse the input

Parameters:
- `text`: the text to display to the user when asking for input
- `default`: optionally set a default value that the user can immediately accept
- `parser`: a function that parses in the user input as a string and returns the parsed value or raises
- `hide_input`: whether the input shouldn't be displayed as the user types (for passwords, API keys, etc.)
- `max_attempts`: how many times to ask the user before giving up and raising


## Spinners

### `Spin`

```python
class Spin(Enum): ...
```

The spinning animation you'd like to use. The spinners are sourced from the NPM [cli-spinners](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-spinners) package.

You can see all the spinners in action by running `uv run -m examples.spinner`. The full list can be found in the code [here](https://github.com/danimelchor/clypi/blob/master/clypi/_data/spinners.py).

### `Spinner`

A spinner indicating that something is happening behind the scenes. Usage is quite easy:

```python
import asyncio
from clypi import Spinner

async def main():
    async with Spinner("Doing something") as s:
        asyncio.sleep(2)
        s.title = "Slept for a bit"
        s.log("I slept for a bit, will sleep a bit more")
        asyncio.sleep(2)

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### `Spinner.__init__()`

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    title: str,
    animation: Spin | list[str] = Spin.DOTS,
    prefix: str = " ",
    suffix: str = "â€¦",
    speed: float = 1,
)
```
Parameters:
- `title`: the initial text to display as the spinner spins
- `animation`: a provided [`Spin`](#spin) animation or a list of frames to display
- `prefix`: text or padding displayed before the icon
- `suffix`: text or padding displayed after the icon
- `speed`: a multiplier to speed or slow down the frame rate of the animation

#### `done`

```python
def done(self, msg: str | None = None)
```
Mark the spinner as done early and optionally display a message.

#### `fail`

```python
def fail(self, msg: str | None = None)
```
Mark the spinner as failed early and optionally display an error message.

#### `log`

```python
def log(self, msg: str | None = None)
```
Display extra log messages to the user as the spinner spins and your work progresses.

#### `pipe`

```python
async def pipe(
    self,
    pipe: asyncio.StreamReader | None,
    color: ColorType = "blue",
    prefix: str = "",
)
```
Pipe the output of an async subprocess into the spinner and display the stdout or stderr
with a particular color and prefix.

Examples:
> ```python
> async def main():
>     async with Spinner("Doing something") as s:
>         proc = await asyncio.create_subprocess_shell(
>             "for i in $(seq 1 10); do date && sleep 0.4; done;",
>             stdout=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
>             stderr=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
>         )
>         await asyncio.gather(
>             s.pipe(proc.stdout, color="blue", prefix="(stdout)"),
>             s.pipe(proc.stderr, color="red", prefix="(stdout)"),
>         )
> ```

## Stack

```python
def stack(*blocks: list[str], padding: int = 1) -> str:
def stack(*blocks: list[str], padding: int = 1, lines: bool) -> list[str]:
```

Horizontally aligns blocks of text to display a nice layout where each block is displayed
side by side.


<img width="974" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9340d828-f7ce-491c-b0a8-6a666f7b7caf" />

Parameters:
- `blocks`: a series of blocks of lines of strings to display side by side
- `padding`: the space between each block
- `lines`: if the output should be returned as lines or as a string

Examples:
```python
names = clypi.boxed(["Daniel", "Pedro", "Paul"], title="Names", width=15)
colors = clypi.boxed(["Blue", "Red", "Green"], title="Colors", width=15)
print(clypi.stack(names, colors))
```
