# zmbus-sdk

A Python SDK for interacting with Zimasa medical systems. This library simplifies integration with Zimasa's healthcare APIs, allowing developers to easily access and manage medical data, patient records, and healthcare services.

## Installation

You can install the package directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install zmbus-sdk
```

For development installation:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shikoli-makatiani/zimabus-sdk.git
cd zimabus-sdk

# Install with Poetry
poetry install
```

## Quick Start

```python
from zimasabus_sdk import zmsystem
from zimasabus_sdk.zimasa import AppointmentService, FollowUpService

# Initialize the client with your credentials
client = zmsystem.ZMSystem(
    api_key="your_api_key",
    base_url="https://api.zimasa.com/v1"
)

# Example: Get patient information
patient = client.get_patient(patient_id="12345")
print(f"Patient Name: {patient.full_name}")

# Example: Submit medical records
response = client.submit_medical_record(
    patient_id="12345",
    record_data={
        "diagnosis": "Hypertension",
        "treatment": "Prescribed medication",
        "notes": "Follow-up in 2 weeks"
    }
)

# Example: Using the AppointmentService
appointment_service = AppointmentService()
service_types = appointment_service.get_appointment_service_types()
print(f"Available service types: {len(service_types.content)}")

# Example: Using the FollowUpService
followup_service = FollowUpService()
provider_id = followup_service.get_provider_user_id("user_entity_id")
appointments = followup_service.get_appointments({"providerUserId": provider_id})
print(f"Found {len(appointments.content)} appointments")
```
