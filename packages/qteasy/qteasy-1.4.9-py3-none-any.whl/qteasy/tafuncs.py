        (middle band) and an upper and lower band.
        The upper and lower bands are typically 2 standard deviations ± from a
        20-day simple moving average, but can be modified.

    Kaufman's Adaptive Moving Average (KAMA) is a moving average designed

    low. KAMA will adjust when the price swings widen and follow prices
    from a greater distance. This trend-following indicator can be used to
    identify the overall trend, time turning points and filter price
    movements.

    Calculation:

    Before calculating KAMA, we need to calculate the Efficiency Ratio
    (ER) and the Smoothing Constant (SC). Thus calculation of KAMA takes
    following steps:

    step1, Efficiency Ratio (ER):

    ER = Change/Volatility
    Change = ABS(Close - Close (10 periods ago))
    Volatility = Sum10(ABS(Close - Prior Close))

    Volatility is the sum of the absolute value of the last ten price
    changes (Close - Prior Close).

    step2, Smoothing Constant (SC)

    SC = [ER x (fastest SC - slowest SC) + slowest SC]2
    SC = [ER x (2/(2+1) - 2/(30+1)) + 2/(30+1)]2

    by Welles Wilder. This system attempts to measure the strength
    of price movement in positive and negative direction using the
    DMI+ and DMI- indicators along with the ADX.

    the ADX indicates movements of prices as following:

    - Wilder suggests that a strong trend is present when ADX is above
    25 and no trend is present when below 20.

    - When the ADX turns down from high values, then the trend may be
    ending. You may want to do additional research to determine if
    closing open positions is appropriate for you.

    - If the ADX is declining, it could be an indication that the market
    is becoming less directional, and the current trend is weakening. You
    may want to avoid trading trend systems as the trend changes.

    - If after staying low for a lengthy time, the ADX rises by 4 or 5
    units, (for example, from 15 to 20), it may be giving a signal to
    trade the current trend.

    - If the ADX is rising then the market is showing a strengthening trend.
    The value of the ADX is proportional to the slope of the trend. The
    slope of the ADX line is proportional to the acceleration of the price
    movement (changing trend slope). If the trend is a constant slope then

    The Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO) is a technical momentum
    indicator developed by Tushar Chande. The CMO indicator is
    created by calculating the difference between the sum of all
    recent higher closes and the sum of all recent lower closes and
    then dividing the result by the sum of all price movement over
    a given time period. The result is multiplied by 100 to give
    the -100 to +100 range. The defined time period is usually 20
    periods.

    - CMO indicates overbought conditions when it reaches the 50
    level and oversold conditions when it reaches −50. You can
    also look for signals based on the CMO crossing above and
    below a signal line composed of a 9-period moving average of
    the 20 period CMO.

    - CMO measures the trend strength. The higher the absolute
    value of the CMO, the stronger the trend. Lower absolute
    values of the CMO indicate sideways trading ranges.

    - CMO often forms chart patterns which may not show on the
    underlying price chart, such as double tops and bottoms and
    trend config_lines. Also look for support or resistance on the CMO.

    - If underlying prices make a new high or low that is not
    confirmed by the CMO, the divergence can signal a price reversal.

    Calculation:
    CMO = 100 * ((Su - Sd)/ ( Su + Sd ) )
    Where:
    Su = Sum of the difference between the current close and previous
    close on up days for the specified period. Up days are days when
    the current close is greater than the previous close.
    Sd = Sum of the absolute value of the difference between the
    current close and the previous close on down days for the specified
    period. Down days are days when the current close is less than the
    previous close.

    """Directional Movement Index 方向运动指数:

    The Directional Movement Index (DMI) assists in determining if a security
    is trending and attempts to measure the strength of the trend. The DMI
    disregards the direction of the security. It only attempts to determine
    if there is a trend and that trends strength.
    The indicator is made up of four indicator config_lines:

    - Positive Directional Indicator (+DMI) shows the difference between today’s
    high price and yesterday’s high price. These values are then added up from
    the past 14 periods and then plotted.
    - Negative Directional Indicator (–DMI) shows the difference between today’s
    low price and yesterday’s low price. These values are then summed up from
    the past 14 periods and plotted.
    - Average Directional Movement Index (ADX). ADX is a smoothing of the DX.
    - Average Directional Movement Index Rating (ADXR) is a simple average of
    today’s ADX value and the ADX from 14 periods ago.

    How to use:

    - High and rising levels of the ADX and ADXR indicate a strong trend, either
    up or down, signifying a trend following system may be appropriate. Typically
    if the ADX is above 25 it indicates a strong trend.

    - Low and falling levels of the ADX and ADXR indicate a trendless market.
    Typically if the ADX is below 20 it indicates a trendless market.

    - A buy signal is given when DMI+ crosses above DMI-. A sell signal is given
    when DMI- crosses above DMI+. The ADX and ADXR config_lines are then used to measure
    the strength of these signals.

    Calculation
    Calculate the True Range, +DI, and –DI for each period:
    True Range is the greater of:
    Current High – Current Low
    Absolute value of Current High – Previous Close
    Absolute value of Current Low – Previous Close

    +DI
    IF Current High – Previous High > Previous Low – Current Low
        THEN +DI = the greater of Current High – Previous High OR 0

    -DI
    IF Previous Low – Current Low > Current High – Previous High
        THEN –DI = the greater of Previous Low – Current Low OR 0

    IF +DI AND -DI are both negative
        THEN both +DI and –DI = 0

    IF +DI AND -DI are both positive AND +DI > -DI
        THEN +DI = Current High – Previous High AND –DI = 0
    Else IF +DI < -DI
        THEN +DI = 0 AND –DI = Previous Low – Current Low
        Smooth the True Range, +DI, and –DI using Wilder’s smoothing technique.
        Divide the smoothed +DI by the smoothed True Range and multiply by 100 (this is
        the +DI that is plotted for the specified period).

    Divide the smoothed –DI by the smooth True Range and multiply by 100 (this is the
    –DI that is plotted for the specified period).

    Next calculate the Directional Movement Index (DX) which equals the (absolute
    value of the smoothed +DI – the smoothed –DI) /( the sum of the smoothed +DI and
    smoothed –DI )and multiply by 100.

    Next calculate the Average Directional Index (ADX). The first value for ADX is an
    average of the DX over the specified period. The following values are smoothed by
    multiplying the previous ADX value by the specified period – 1, adding the current
    DX value, and dividing this total by the period specified.

    Finally the Directional Movement Rating (ADXR) is calculated by the averaging the
    current ADX and the ADX value n-periods ago.

    The Money Flow Index (MFI) is a momentum indicator that measures the
    flow of money into and out of a security over a specified period of time.
    It is related to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) but incorporates volume,
    whereas the RSI only considers price. The MFI is calculated by accumulating
    positive and negative Money Flow values (see Money Flow), then creating a
    Money Ratio. The Money Ratio is then normalized into the MFI oscillator
    form.

    - Oversold levels typically occur below 20 and overbought levels typically
    occur above 80. These levels may change depending on market conditions.
    Level config_lines should cut across the highest peaks and the lowest troughs.
    Oversold/Overbought levels are generally not reason enough to buy/sell; and
    traders should consider additional technical analysis or research to confirm
    the security's turning point. Keep in mind, during strong trends, the MFI
    may remain overbought or oversold for extended periods.

    - If the underlying price makes a new high or low that isn't confirmed by
    the MFI, this divergence can signal a price reversal.

    Calculation
    The Money Flow Index requires a series of calculations.
    - First, the period's Typical Price is calculated.
    - Typical Price = (High + Low + Close)/3
    - Next, Money Flow (not the Money Flow Index) is calculated by multiplying
    the period's Typical Price by the volume.
    - Money Flow = Typical Price * Volume
    - If today's Typical Price is greater than yesterday's Typical Price, it is
    considered Positive Money Flow. If today's price is less, it is considered
    Negative Money Flow.
    - Positive Money Flow is the sum of the Positive Money over the specified
    number of periods.
    - Negative Money Flow is the sum of the Negative Money over the specified
    number of periods.
    - The Money Ratio is then calculated by dividing the Positive Money Flow by
    the Negative Money Flow.
    - Money Ratio = Positive Money Flow / Negative Money Flow
    - Finally, the Money Flow Index is calculated using the Money Ratio.

    The PPO is used to compare asset performance and volatility, spot divergence which
    could lead to price reversals, generate trade signals, and help confirm trend direction.
    The PPO is identical to the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator,
    except the PPO measures percentage difference between two EMAs, while the MACD measures
    absolute (dollar) difference. Some traders prefer the PPO because readings are
    comparable between assets with different prices, whereas MACD readings are not comparable.

    - The PPO typical contains two config_lines, the PPO line, and the signal line. The signal line
    is an EMA of PPO, so it moves slower than the PPO.

    - The PPO crossing the signal line is used by some traders as a trade signal. When it
    crosses above from below, that is a buy, when it crosses below from above that is a sell.

    - When the PPO is above zero that helps indicate an uptrend, as the short-term EMA is
    above the longer-term EMA.

    - When the PPO is below zero, the short-term average is below the longer-term average,
    which helps indicate a downtrend.

    Calculation:
    - Calculate the 12-period EMA of the asset's price.
    - Calculate the 26-period EMA of the asset's price.
    - Apply these to the PPO formula to get the current PPO value.
    - Once there are at least nine PPO values, generate the signal line by calculating the
    nine-period EMA of the PPO.

    The stochastic indicator is a momentum indicator developed by George C. Lane in the 1950s,
    which shows the position of the most recent closing price relative to the previous high-low
    range. The indicator measures momentum by comparing the closing price with the previous
    trading range over a specific period of time.

    The stochastic indicator is widely used in the Forex community. It consists of two config_lines:
    the indicator line %K, and the signal or trigger line %D. The stochastic indicator can be
    used to identify oversold and overbought conditions, as well as to spot divergences between
    the price and the indicator.

    - A reading above 80 is usually considered as overbought, while a reading below 20 is
    considered oversold. However, the price can remain in overbought and oversold conditions
    for a long period of time, especially during strong up- and downtrends.

    - A divergence occurs when the price “diverges” from the indicator, i.e. the price makes
    lower lows while the indicator makes higher lows, or the price makes higher highs while the
    indicator makes lower highs.

    - As with any momentum indicator, traders should wait for additional confirmation signals
    to enter a trade, as these types of indicators can occasionally give false signals.

    The stochastic indicator is calculated using the following formula:

    %K = (Most Recent Closing Price - Lowest Low) / (Highest High - Lowest Low) × 100

    %D = 3-day SMA of %K

    Lowest Low = the lowest low of the specified time period

    The Stochastic RSI (StochRSI) is an indicator used in technical analysis that ranges
    between zero and one (or zero and 100 on some charting platforms) and is created by
    applying the Stochastic oscillator formula to a set of relative strength index (RSI)
    values rather than to standard price data. Using RSI values within the Stochastic
    formula gives traders an idea of whether the current RSI value is overbought or
    oversold.

    - A StochRSI reading above 0.8 is considered overbought, while a reading below 0.2
    is considered oversold. On the zero to 100 scale, above 80 is overbought, and below
    20 is oversold.

    - Overbought doesn't necessarily mean the price will reverse lower, just like
    oversold doesn't mean the price will reverse higher. Rather the overbought and
    oversold conditions simply alert traders that the RSI is near the extremes of its
    recent readings.

    - A reading of zero means the RSI is at its lowest level in 14 periods (or whatever
    lookback period is chosen). A reading of 1 (or 100) means the RSI is at the highest
    level in the last 14 periods.

    - Other StochRSI values show where the RSI is relative to a high or low

    How to Calculate the Stochastic RSI
    The StochRSI is based on RSI readings. The RSI has an input value, typically 14,
    which tells the indicator how many periods of data it is using in its calculation.
    These RSI levels are then used in the StochRSI formula.

    - Record RSI levels for 14 periods.

    The Ultimate Oscillator is a technical indicator that was developed by Larry Williams
    in 1976 to measure the price momentum of an asset across multiple timeframes. By using
    the weighted average of three different timeframes the indicator has less volatility
    and fewer trade signals compared to other oscillators that rely on a single timeframe.
    Buy and sell signals are generated following divergences. The Ultimately Oscillator
    generates fewer divergence signals than other oscillators due to its multi-timeframe
    construction.

    - The indicator uses three timeframes in its calculation: seven, 14, and 28 periods.

    - The shorter timeframe has the most weight in the calculation, while the longer
    timeframe has the least weight.

    - Buy signals occur when there is bullish divergence, the divergence low is below 30
    on the indicator, and the oscillator then rises above the divergence high.

    - A sell signal occurs when there is bearish divergence, the divergence high is above
    70, and the oscillator then falls below the divergence low.

    How to Calculate the Ultimate Oscillator

    - Calculate the Buying Pressure (BP) which is the close price of the period less the
    low of that period or prior close, whichever is lower. Record these values for each
    period as they will be summed up over the last seven, 14, and 28 periods to create
    BP Sum.

    - Calculate the True Range (TR) which is the current period's high or the prior close,
    whichever is higher, minus the lowest value of the current period's low or the prior
    close. Record these values for each period as they will be summed up over the last
    seven, 14, and 28 periods to create TR Sum.

    - Calculate Average7, 14, and 28 using the BP and TR Sums calculations from steps one
    and two. For example, the Average7 BP Sum is the calculated BP values added together
    for the last seven periods.

    - Calculate the Ultimate Oscillator using the Average7, 14, and 28 values. Average7
    has a weight of four, Average14 has a weight of two, and Average28 has a weight of
    one. Sum the weights in the denominator (in this case, the sum is seven, or 4+2+1).
    Multiply by 100 when other calculations are complete.

    Ultimate Oscillator 是一种技术指标，由 Larry Williams 于 1976 年开发，用于衡量资产在多个时间
    范围内的价格动量。通过使用三个不同时间框架的加权平均值，与其他依赖单一时间框架的振荡器相比，该指标的
    波动性和交易信号更少。出现分歧后会产生买入和卖出信号。由于其多时间框架结构，最终振荡器产生的发散信号
    少于其他振荡器。

    - 该指标在其计算中使用三个时间框架：7、14 和 28 个周期。

    - 较短的时间范围在计算中的权重最大，而较长的时间范围的权重最小。

    - 当出现看涨背离时出现买入信号，指标上背离低点低于 30，然后震荡指标升至背离高点上方。

    - 当出现看跌背离时出现卖出信号，背离高点高于 70，然后震荡指标跌破背离低点。

    如何计算终极振荡器

    - 计算买入压力 (BP)，即该时段的收盘价减去该时段的低点或前一收盘价，以较低者为准。记录每个时期的这些值，
    因为它们将在过去 7 个、14 个和 28 个时期相加，以创建 BP 总和。

    - 计算真实范围 (TR)，即当前时段的高点或前收盘价，以较高者为准，减去当前时段的低点或前收盘价的最低值。
    记录每个时期的这些值，因为它们将在过去 7 个、14 个和 28 个时期相加，以创建 TR Sum。

    - 使用第一步和第二步中的 BP 和 TR 总和计算来计算平均值 7、14 和 28。例如，Average7 BP Sum 是过去
    七个期间计算的 BP 值相加。

    - 使用平均 7、14 和 28 值计算终极振荡器。平均 7 的权重为 4，平均 14 的权重为 2，平均 28 的权重为 1。
    将分母中的权重相加（在这种情况下，和为 7，或 4+2+1）。其他计算完成后乘以 100。

    Average True Range (ATR) is the average of true ranges over the specified period. ATR
    measures volatility, taking into account any gaps in the price movement. Typically,
    the ATR calculation is based on 14 periods, which can be intraday, daily, weekly, or
    monthly. To measure recent volatility, use a shorter average, such as 2 to 10 periods.
    For longer-term volatility, use 20 to 50 periods.

    - An expanding ATR indicates increased volatility in the market, with the range of each
    bar getting larger. A reversal in price with an increase in ATR would indicate strength
    behind that move. ATR is not directional so an expanding ATR can indicate selling
    pressure or buying pressure. High ATR values usually result from a sharp advance or
    decline and are unlikely to be sustained for extended periods.

    - A low ATR value indicates a series of periods with small ranges (quiet days). These
    low ATR values are found during extended sideways price action, thus the lower
    volatility. A prolonged period of low ATR values may indicate a consolidation area and
    the possibility of a continuation move or reversal.

    - ATR is very useful for stops or entry triggers, signaling changes in volatility.
    Whereas fixed dollar- point or percentage stops will not allow for volatility, the ATR
    stop will adapt to sharp price moves or consolidation areas, which can trigger an
    abnormal price movement in either direction. Use a multiple of ATR, such as 1.5 x ATR,

    Instantaneous Period) returns the period of the Dominant Cycle of the analytic signal as
    generated by the Hilbert Transform. The Dominant Cycle can be thought of as being the
    "most likely" period (in the range of 10 to 40) of a sine function of the Price Series.

    The HTPeriod at a specific bar gives the current Hilbert Transform Period as
    instantaneously measured at that bar in the range of 10 to 40. It is meaningful only
    during a cyclic period of the analytic signal waveform (price series) being measured.
    The HTPeriod, or one of its sub-periods, is often used to adjust other indicators; for
    example, Stochastics and RSIs work best when using a half cycle period to peak their
    performance. Similarly other indicators can be made to be adaptive by using the HTPeriod,
    or one of its sub-periods, as the period of the indicator.

    of a de-trended real-valued "analytic-like" signal (such as a Price Series) in order to
    analyze variations of the instantaneous phase and amplitude.. HTDCPhase returns the
    Hilbert Transform Phase of the Dominant Cycle. The Dominant Cycle Phase lies in the
    range of 0 to 360 degrees. The Hilbert Transform Sine is just the sine of the DC Phase.

    The DC Phase at a specific bar gives the phase position from 0 to 360 degrees within the
    current Hilbert Transform Period instantaneously measured at that bar. The HTSin is the
    sine of the DC Phase at a specific bar. The HTLeadSin is the sine of the DC Phase at a
    specific bar. They are most often used together to identify cyclic turning points.

    The basic flow and simplified pseudo code for the computation for the Dominant Cycle
    Phase as part of the computation of the Dominant Cycle is:

    Compute the Hilbert Transform
        {Detrend Price}
        {Compute InPhase and Quadrature components}
    Compute the Period of the Dominant Cycle
        {Use ArcTangent to compute the current phase}
        {Resolve the ArcTangent ambiguity}
        {Compute a differential phase, resolve phase wraparound, and limit delta phase errors}
        {Sum DeltaPhases to reach 360 degrees.  The sum is the instantaneous period.}
        {Resolve Instantaneous Period errors and smooth}
    Compute Dominant Cycle Phase
    Compute the Sine of the Dominant Cycle Phase
    Return the Sine of the Dominant Cycle Phase at the current bar of the Hilbert Transform
    Period measured at that bar

    The basic flow and simplified pseudo code for the computation for the HTLeadSin is:

    Compute the Hilbert Transform
        {Detrend Price}
        {Compute InPhase and Quadrature components}
    Compute the Period of the Dominant Cycle
        {Use ArcTangent to compute the current phase}

        {Sum DeltaPhases to reach 360 degrees.  The sum is the instantaneous period.}
        {Resolve Instantaneous Period errors and smooth}
    Compute Dominant Cycle Phase
    Compute the Sine of the Dominant Cycle Phase
    Advance the Sine by 45 degrees to compute the HT Lead Sine
    Return the Lead Sine of the Dominant Cycle Phase at the current bar of the Hilbert Transform Period measured at

    Bullish engulfing pattern:
    The bullish engulfing pattern is a two-candle reversal pattern. The second candle
    completely ‘engulfs’ the real body of the first one, without regard to the length of
    the ellipsis shadows. The Bullish Engulfing pattern appears in a downtrend and is a
    combination of one dark candle followed by a larger hollow candle. On the second day
    of the pattern, price opens lower than the previous low, yet buying pressure pushes
    the price up to a higher level than the previous high, culminating in an obvious win
    for the buyers. It is advisable to enter a long position when the price moves higher
    than the high of the second engulfing candle—in other words when the downtrend
    reversal is confirmed.

    - A bullish engulfing pattern is a candlestick chart pattern that forms when a small
    black candlestick is followed the next day by a large white candlestick, the body of
    which completely overlaps or engulfs the body of the previous day’s candlestick.

    - Bullish engulfing patterns are more likely to signal reversals when they are preceded
    by four or more black candlesticks.

    - Investors should look not only to the two candlesticks which form the bullish
    engulfing pattern but also to the preceding candlesticks

    Bearish engulfing pattern:
    A bearish engulfing pattern is a technical chart pattern that signals lower prices to
    come. The pattern consists of an up (white or green) candlestick followed by a large
    down (black or red) candlestick that eclipses or "engulfs" the smaller up candle. The
    pattern can be important because it shows sellers have overtaken the buyers and are
    pushing the price more aggressively down (down candle) than the buyers were able to
    push it up (up candle).

    - A bearish engulfing pattern can occur anywhere, but it is more significant if it
    occurs after a price advance. This could be an uptrend or a pullback to the upside
    with a larger downtrend.

    - Ideally, both candles are of substantial size relative to the price bars around them.
    Two very small bars may create an engulfing pattern, but it is far less significant
    than if both candles are large.

    - The real body—the difference between the open and close price—of the candlesticks is
    what matters. The real body of the down candle must engulf the up candle.

    - The pattern has far less significance in choppy markets.

    will continue moving in the current trend direction, down or up, as the case may be.

    - There is an up and down version of the pattern. The up version is a white candle

    - The pattern has moderate reliability in terms of the trend continuing after the
    pattern, but quite often the price move after the pattern will be muted, indicating
    it is not a highly significant pattern.

    - The piercing pattern is a two-day candle pattern that implies a potential reversal from a
    downward trend to an upward trend.

    - This candle pattern typically only forecasts about five days out.

    after the first day, and a strong reversal as the second candle in the pattern.

    - Rising three methods is a bullish continuation candlestick pattern that occurs in an uptrend

    - The decisive (fifth) strongly bullish candle is proof that sellers did not have enough

    denoting the high and low traded price for that period, are shallow.

    Falling Three Methods:
    The "falling three methods" is a bearish, five candle continuation pattern that signals an
    interruption, but not a reversal, of the current downtrend. The pattern is characterized by
    two long candlesticks in the direction of the trend, in this case down, at the beginning and

    a shooting star is a type of candlestick that forms when a security opens, advances

    For a candlestick to be considered a shooting star, the formation must appear during a price

    - Traders typically wait to see what the next candle (period) does following a shooting star.
    If the price declines during the next period they may sell or short.

    hand. The buyers pushed the price up during the period, and the sellers pushed the price

    After a strong price advance or decline, spinning tops can signal a potential price
    reversal, if the candle that follows confirms.

    A spinning top can have a close above or below the open, but the two prices need to be
    close together.

    - Spinning tops are symmetrical, with upper and lower shadows of approximately equal length.

    - The real body should be small, showing little difference between the open and close prices.

    - Since buyers and sellers both pushed the price, but couldn't maintain it, the pattern
    shows indecision and that more sideways movement could follow.

    - Following a strong move higher or lower, a spinning top shows that the trend traders may
    be losing conviction. For example, following a strong up move, a spinning top shows buyers
    may be losing some of their control and a reversal to the downside could be near.

    - Spinning tops, and nearly all candlestick patterns, require confirmation. If a spinning
    top could be the start of a reversal, the next candle should confirm. If the spinning top is

    The upside gap two crows is viewed by chartists as a somewhat ominous pattern, since it
    potentially signals that the index or security may be rolling over as its upward move ends and

    (on Days 2 and 3), the bulls have been unable to maintain upward momentum, suggesting that
    sentiment is turning from bullish to bearish.
    Although fairly rare, the upside gap two crows pattern certainly can certainly be foreboding.
