      "summary": "The provided repository contains several research papers that have not been directly focused on planning applications, but some are innovative in the context of text generation and related areas. Here is an evaluation based on your criteria: \n\n1. **DeTiME - Diffusion-Enhanced Topic Modeling**\n   - **Score:** 0.7\n   - **Evaluation:** This paper introduces DeTiME, which focuses on generating topics using diffusion with encoder-decoder-based LLMs. While it has some value for topic modeling and text generation, the direct connection to planning applications is limited.\n\n2. **InfoDiffusion: Information Entropy Aware Diffusion Process**\n   - **Score:** 0.5\n   - **Evaluation:** This paper explores non-autoregressive text generation but does not directly address planning with language models.\n\n3. **Beyond Autoregression: Discrete Diffusion for Complex Reasoning and Planning**\n   - **Score:** 0.85\n   - **Evaluation:** This is a more relevant paper as it discusses the application of diffusion-based models in complex reasoning and planning tasks, specifically in robust text inference. It demonstrates practical utility but does not cover extensive applications in traditional planning methods.\n\n4. **Patterns of Persistence and Diffusibility**\n   - **Score:** 0.5\n   - **Evaluation:** This paper focuses on data generation and synthesis using diffusion models, lacking direct application to language model planning.",
