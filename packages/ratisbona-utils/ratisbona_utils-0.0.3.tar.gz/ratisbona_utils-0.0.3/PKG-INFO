# Ratisbona Utils

Ratisbona utils comprises a set of python modules useful in many programs. 

## Project-structure, Installing Dependencies and PYTHONPATH configuration.

This Project houses its sources below the `src/ratisbona_utils` directory. You have
to have this directory in your module-searchpath to execute the project. It should also
be present in the module-searchpath of your IDE.

If using pycharm or any other Jetbrains-based IDE, use 
`Settings->Project->Project Structure`
to `mark as sourcefolder` the `src`-folder of this.

The Project requirements, as well as the dev-requirements are intended to be listed in the 
`pyproject.toml`-file (see there)

By issuing:

```shell
pip install -e .
```

you add all the project dependencies as well as the projects source-folder to your
(hopefully virtual!) environment, relieving you of the burden of having to manually 
installing anything or having to configure your python path by other means.

Likewise you can install all the dev-dependencies by:

```shell
pip install -e .'[dev]'
```
