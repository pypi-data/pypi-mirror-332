def search_jobs(title: str, size: int = 5):
    request = JobSearchRequest(title=title, size=size)
    
    try:
        results = JobSearchService.search_jobs(request)
        jobs = results.get("jobs", [])
        
        if not jobs:
            print("No job results found.")
            return
        
        print("Job Search Results:")
        for job in jobs:
            job_name = job.get("name", "N/A")
            company = job.get("companyName", "N/A")
            location = job.get("location", {})
            city = location.get("city", "Unknown")
            state = location.get("state", "Unknown")
            country = location.get("country", "Unknown")
            source = job.get("feed", "N/A")
            posted_date = job.get("created", "N/A")
            
            print(f"Job: {job_name} at {company}")
            print(f"Location: {city}, {state}, {country}")
            print(f"Source: {source}")
            print(f"Posted: {posted_date}\n")
