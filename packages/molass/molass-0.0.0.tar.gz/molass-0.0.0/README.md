# Molass Library

Molass Library is a rewrite of [MOLASS](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/biophysico/20/1/20_e200001/_article), an analytical tool for SEC-SAXS experiment data currently ported at [Photon Factory](https://pfwww.kek.jp/saxs/MOLASS.html). It is designed to be suitable for scripting in Jupyter notebooks, thereby obtaining greater flexibility compared to the predecessor thanks to the Python ecosystem diversity.
