    """Run a coroutine synchronously.

    This function uses anyio to run a coroutine in a synchronous context.
    It attempts the following strategies in order:
    1. Tries to run using anyio's run function directly
    2. If that fails (already in an async context), runs in a new thread

    Context variables are properly propagated between threads in all cases.

    Example:
    ```python
    async def f(x: int) -> int:
        return x + 1

    result = run_sync(f(1))
    ```

    This function creates a new thread to run the coroutine with anyio.
    Context variables are properly propagated between threads.
    This is useful when you need to run async code in a context where you can't use
    the current event loop (e.g., inside an async frame).

    Example:
    ```python
    async def f(x: int) -> int:
        return x + 1
