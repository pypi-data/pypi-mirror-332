/*
    fen.h

    This file contains the function to create a board from a fen string.
    In the future a Board_AsFen would be added to this file to convert the board
    to a fen string.

    The way Board_NewFen behaves would change in the future to be able to create
    the board on the stack and without the need to allocate memory for the board.
