    def _makemove(self, move: int | str) -> None:
        """
        Privately applies a move to the board without legality checks.

        This is a private function, intended for internal use. However, it is provided 
        for programmers who may need finer control over move execution. Unlike `step`, 
        which ensures the move is legal before applying it, `_makemove` blindly executes 
        the given move without any validation.

        This makes `_makemove` useful in scenarios where legality is already ensured, 
        such as when selecting a move from a pre-generated list of legal moves. Since it 
        skips legality checks, it is technically faster than `step`.

        Example use case:
            If you generate legal moves and are certain that the selected move is valid, 
            you can use `_makemove` instead of `step` for better performance:
            
            ```python
            legal_moves = board.generate_legal_moves(as_set=True)
            move = some_selection_function(legal_moves)
            board._makemove(move)  # Faster than board.step(move) since legality is known
            ```

        Parameters:
            move (int | str): The move to be applied.
                - If `int`, it represents an encoded move.
                - If `str`, it is the UCI (Universal Chess Interface) representation of the move.

def move_from_uci(uci: str, move_type: int = None) -> Move:
    """
    Converts a UCI move notation (e.g., "e2e4" or "e7e8q") into a Move object.

    # Note:
        The move type cannot be determined solely from the UCI string.
        UCI moves may represent Normal or Promotion types. However, if the move 
        is an En Passant or Castling move, the type must be specified manually. 

        The `Board.step` function does not require an explicit move type; it only 
        considers the source and destination squares and automatically determines 
        legality. If the type is not provided, `Board.step` will still execute the 
        move correctly.

        However, `Board._makemove` requires the correct move type. This means that 
        while a UCI string is sufficient for `Board.step`, it is not enough for 
        `Board._makemove`. If legal moves are generated and include Castling or 
        En Passant moves, constructing a move solely from the UCI string will 
        not detect these special moves, even if they share the same source and 
        destination squares.

        ## Example:
        ```python
        move1 = move_from_uci("e5d6", move_type=MOVE_ENPASSANT)
        move2 = move_from_uci("e5d6")

        # move1 is not equal to move2
        # However, both board.step(move1) and board.step(move2) will produce 
        # the same result, whereas board._makemove(move1)
        # and board._makemove(move2) will not.

        # Additionally, if we generate legal moves as a set and assume there is 
        # an En Passant move among them:
        legal_moves = board.generate_legal_moves(as_set=True)

        print(move1 in legal_moves)  # True
        print(move2 in legal_moves)  # False
        ```
            
    Parameters:
        uci (str): The UCI representation of the move (e.g., "e2e4" for a normal move 
                   or "e7e8q" for promotion).
        move_type (int, optional): The type of move, required for En Passant and Castling.
