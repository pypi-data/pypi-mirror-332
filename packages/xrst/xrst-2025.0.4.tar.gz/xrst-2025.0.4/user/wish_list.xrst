Wish List
#########
The following is a wish list for future improvements to ``run_xrst``.
If you want to help with one of these, or some other aspect of xrst,
open an `xrst issue <https://github.com/bradbell/xrst/issues>`_ .

Spell Checking
**************

#. If a spelling warning occurs inside a
   :ref:`template_cmd@template_file`
   the error message identifies the page file,
   but not the template file,
   where the error occurred.
   This should be fixed so that both files are identified.

#. ``:ref:`` references that use the xrst ``-title`` should detect
   special words in the page name (similar to ``-name`` references).
   The corresponding check for double word error should use the page title
   instead of name because that is what the user sees.

#. Spell checking should not require a special word for any valid role names;
.e.g, the following text should not require a special spelling entry for
``samp`` ::

   :samp:`print 1+{variable}`

Theme
*****
It would be nice to have better
:ref:`config_file@html_theme_options@Default` options for more themes
so that they work will with xrst.

sphinx_rtd_theme
================
It would be nice if there were a way to make this theme use more
horizontal space (currently xrst tires to modify its output to do this).

sphinx_book_theme
=================
It would be nice if the sphinx_book_theme did not use the full
width of the display for tables; see issue-807_  .

.. _issue-807: https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-book-theme/issues/807


Search
******
It would be nice if we could make the sphinx search act like the
xrst search page (so we would not need two searches) .

RST Command File Names
**********************
It would be nice if all commands in the rst files used file names
were automatically mapped so they were relative to the
:ref:`config_file@directory@project_directory` .
If this were the case, one would not need the
:ref:`dir command<dir_cmd-title>` .
In addition, the file names should not be checked for spelling
(this is already true for the ``ref`` role).

Tabs
****
Tabs in xrst input is not tested because
tabs in a code blocks get expanded to 8 spaces; see stackoverflow_.
Perhaps we should add a command line option that sets the tab stops,
convert the tabs to spaces when a file is read,
and not include tabs in any of the processing after that.
