Spell Command Example
#####################

Text
****
The word ``iterable`` is not in the dictionary,
so we have included it in the special words for this page.

Spelling File
*************
The word ``xrst`` is not in the special words for this page because
it is in the configuration file's project dictionary
that was used to build this documentation.

Math
****
Words that are preceded by a backslash; e.g., latex commands,
are automatically considered correct spelling.

.. math::

   z = \cos( \theta ) + {\rm i} \sin( \theta )

Double Words
************
It is considered an error to have only white space between
two occurrences of the same word; e.g.,
no no would be an error if there
were not two occurrences of ``no`` next to each other in the
spelling command for this page.

Off and On
**********
In some cases it is better to turn spell checking.
For example when displaying the git hash code:
{xrst_spell_off}
7c35a3ce607a14953f070f0f83b5d74c2296ef93
{xrst_spell_on}

xrst_spell
**********
The file below demonstrates the use of ``xrst_spell``
