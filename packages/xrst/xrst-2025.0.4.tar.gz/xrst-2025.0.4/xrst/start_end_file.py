# is the name of the file that we are displaying. If it is not the same as

# If input_file is equal to display_file, the lines of the file

# ***********
# is the starting text. There must be one and only one copy of this text in the

# end_before
# **********
# is the stopping text. There must be one and only one copy of this text in the
# file (not counting the excluded text). This text has no newlines and cannot
# be empty.  Furthermore, the stopping text must come after the end of the
# starting text. If not, an the error is reported and the program stops.
