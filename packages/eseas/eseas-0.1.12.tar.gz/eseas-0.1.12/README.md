# eseas

eseas is a Python package that acts as a wrapper for the `jwsacruncher` Java package. This tool allows users to process Demetra workspace XML files, create batch files, execute them, and collect the desired outputs into individual Excel files.

## Installation

### eseas

You can install the `eseas` package via pip:

```bash
pip install eseas -U
```

 
## Prerequisites

### jwsacruncher

`eseas` requires the `jwsacruncher` Java package. You can download it
from the [jwsacruncher GitHub releases page](https://github.com/jdemetra/jwsacruncher/releases).

### Setup Instructions

1. Download the latest release of `jwsacruncher` from the [releases page](https://github.com/jdemetra/jwsacruncher/releases).
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Note the path to the `bin` directory inside the unzipped folder.

After downloading `jwsacruncher`, you need to specify its location when using the `Options` function from the `eseas` package.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `eseas` package:

```python
from eseas import Seasonal, Options
import time

def main():
    # Specify the path to the jwsacruncher bin directory
    java_folder = r'../../Downloads/jwsacruncher-2.2.4/bin'
    demetra_source_folder = r"./demetra_source_folder"
    local_folder = r"./test_out"

    options = Options(
        demetra_source_folder,
        java_folder,
        local_folder,
        result_file_names=("sa", "s_f", "cal"), # *1
        workspace_mode=True,
        file_name_explanation=True,
    )
    # Note (1)
    # result_file_names see full list of result types from Demetra Components below

    seas = Seasonal(options)

    seas.part1()
    time.sleep(10)
    seas.part2()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Documentation

For more detailed information, refer to the following guides:

[Documentation](https://eseas-repo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/home.html)

## How it Works

1. **Input Directory**: The user specifies the directory of the Demetra workspace where XML files are located.
2. **Batch File Creation**: The package creates batch files for all XML files in the specified directory.
3. **Execution**: It runs the batch files using the `jwsacruncher` tool.
4. **Output Collection**: The specified outputs are collected and compiled into individual Excel files for each XML file processed.



## Acknowledgments
This package (**eseas**) is an **independent Python wrapper** that interacts with the `jwsacruncher` application.  
Users must **download `jwsacruncher` separately**. This package is **not affiliated with or derived from `jwsacruncher`**.

`jwsacruncher` is a **Java-based implementation** of the .NET application **WSACruncher**. It is a command-line tool that allows users to **re-estimate all multi-processing tasks** defined in a **Demetra workspace**.  

The workspace can be generated by:
- **Demetra+ (.NET)**
- **JDemetra+ (Java)**
- **Any compatible user tool**
