# Packify

This is a simple package that allows one to serialize and deserialize
practically any data structure to and from bytes.

## Installation

```bash
pip install packify
```

## Usage

Usage is simple: import the package and call the pack/unpack functions.

```python
from packify import pack, unpack
from decimal import Decimal

data = {
    123: 432.1,
    "abc": "cba",
    b"abc": b"cba",
    "None": None,
    "true": True,
    "false": False,
    'list': [
        '123',
        123,
        b'123',
        True,
    ],
    'tuple': (
        '123',
        123,
        b'123',
        False,
    ),
    'set': {
        '123',
        123,
        b'123',
    },
    'Decimal': Decimal('123.321'),
}

packed = pack(data)
unpacked = unpack(packed)
assert type(packed) is bytes
assert unpacked == data
```

The following types are supported:

- int
- bool
- float
- Decimal
- str
- bytes
- bytearray
- NoneType
- list
- tuple
- set
- dict

<summary>Using with named tuples</summary>

If you want to use named tuples, you can do so by packing as a regular tuple and
then unpacking it into the named tuple class.

```python
from packify import pack, unpack
from collections import namedtuple

Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])

original = Point(1, 2)
packed = pack(tuple(original))
unpacked = Point(*unpack(packed))
assert unpacked == original
```

The recursive features of `pack` and `unpack` will not work with named tuples
nested within data structures. Using a `Packable` implementation is a better
approach if you need custom data types nested within data structures (see below).

Additionally, a simple duck-type interface/protocol, `Packable`, is included.
Any more complex data structure can be handled if it implements the `Packable`
interface. `Packable` is defined as follows:

```python
@runtime_checkable
class Packable(Protocol):
    def pack(self) -> bytes:
        """Packs the instance into bytes."""
        ...

    @classmethod
    def unpack(cls, data: bytes, /, *, inject: dict = {}) -> Packable:
        """Unpacks an instance from bytes. Must accept dependency
            injection to unpack other Packable types.
        """
        ...
```

If a class that implements `Packable` is used, then it needs to be included in
the `inject` parameter for calls to `unpack`.

<summary>Example</summary>

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from packify import pack, unpack

@dataclass
class Thing:
    data: str = field()
    amount: int = field()
    fraction: float = field()
    parts: list = field()
    def __eq__(self, other) -> bool:
        return type(self) is type(other) and self.pack() == other.pack()
    def pack(self) -> bytes:
        return pack((self.data, self.amount, self.fraction, self.parts))
    @classmethod
    def unpack(cls, data: bytes, /, *, inject: dict = {}):
        return cls(*unpack(data, inject={**globals(), **inject}))

thing = Thing("hello world", 123, 420.69, ['a', b'b', 3])
packed = pack(thing)
unpacked = unpack(packed, inject={'Thing': Thing})
assert unpacked == thing
# alternately, the easier but less specific method is to copy globals
unpacked = unpack(packed, inject={**globals()})
assert unpacked == thing
```
</details>
<br>

As long as the class implements the `Packable` protocol, it can be included in
lists, sets, tuples, and dicts (assuming it is hashable for set or to be used as
a dict key), and it will just work.

The `pack` function will raise a `UsageError` if the data is not serializable,
and the `unpack` function will raise a `UsageError` if it is unable to find a
`Packable` class to unpack the relevant item.

For convenience/use in annotations, a `SerializableType` is exported which
includes the above type information.

## Tests

Since it is a focused package, there are only 11 tests, and they are mostly e2e
tests of both the `pack` and `unpack` functions. After using this for a year, I
found an edge case, and there is a test to prove it has been fixed. I also added
2 fuzz tests to broaden the coverage of the test suite during a major refactor.
To run the tests, clone the repository and use the following:

```bash
python tests/test_serialization.py
python tests/test_fuzzy.py
```
