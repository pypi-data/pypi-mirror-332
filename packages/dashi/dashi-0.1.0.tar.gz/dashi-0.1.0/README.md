Dataset shift analysis and characterization in python
## What is `dashi`?
`dashi` is a Python library designed to **analyze and characterize temporal and multi-source dataset shifts**. It provides 
robust tools for both **supervised and unsupervised evaluation of dataset shifts,** empowering users to detect, understand, 
and address changes in data distributions with confidence.

### Key Features:

- **Supervised Characterization:**
Enables users to create classification or regression models using Random Forests trained on batched data 
(temporal or multi-source). This allows for the detailed analysis of how dataset shifts impact model performance, 
helping to pinpoint areas of potential degradation.
- **Unsupervised Characterization:** 
Facilitates the identification of temporal dataset shifts by projecting and visualizing data dissimilarities across time. 
This process involves:
  - Estimating data statistical distributions over time.
  - Projecting these distributions onto non-parametric statistical manifolds. These projections reveal patterns of
  latent temporal variability in the data, uncovering hidden trends and shifts.

### Visualization Tools:
To aid exploration and interpretation of dataset shifts, `dashi` includes visual analytics features such as:

- **Data Temporal Heatmaps (DTHs):** Provide an exploratory visualization for temporal shifts in data distributions.
- **Information Geometric Temporal (IGT) plots:** Offer a more sophisticated view of temporal data variability by means of embedding temporal batches in their latent statistical manifolds.
- **Multi-batch contingency matrices:** Compare multiple evaluation metrics (F1-Score, Recall, Precision, AUC, etc.) across training-test combinations between pairwise batches, either temporal or multi-source.
