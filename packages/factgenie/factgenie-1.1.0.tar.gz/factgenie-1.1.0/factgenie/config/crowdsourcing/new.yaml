annotator_instructions: |-
  In this task, you will annotate textual outputs. For each example, you will see **inputs** on the left side and the corresponding **text** on the right side. Your task is to **highlight spans** in the text according to the instructions.

  These are the span categories you can mark in the generated text:

  - <span style="background-color: #d73737"><b>Extra</b></span>: test
  - <span style="background-color: #ff2e8f"><b>test</b></span>: test
  - <span style="background-color: #62cb91"><b>fsdfsd</b></span>: fdfsdfs

  You can annotate the errors by selecting the appropriate error category and dragging your mouse over the text, highlighting the error span.

  Once you think you have marked all the errors present in the text, click the **âœ… Mark example as complete** button (you can still update the annotation later).

  You will be able to submit the annotations once they are all are marked as complete.
