    (ROI), the ROI potentially within a larger area.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rc
        Position coordinates (row, column) in an array of shape (n, 2).
        If ``area_shape`` is passed, coordinates are assumed to be given
        with respect to the area origin, and so if ``roi_origin`` is
        passed, the origin is subtracted from the coordinates.
    roi_shape
        Shape of the ROI as (n rows, n columns).
    roi_origin
        Origin (row, column) of the ROI with respect to the area. If
        this and ``area_shape`` is passed, the origin is subtracted
        from the ``rc`` coordinates.
    area_shape
        Shape of the area including the ROI as (n rows, n columns). If
        this and ``roi_origin`` is passed, the origin is subtracted from
        the ``rc`` coordinates.
    roi_image
        Image to plot within the ROI, of the same aspect ratio.
    area_image
        Image to plot within the area, of the same aspect ratio.
    axis
        Existing Matplotlib axis to add the positions to. If not passed,
        a new figure will be created. If passed, only the coordinate
        markers and labels are added to the axis. E.g. ``roi_image`` or
        ``area_image`` will not be used.
    return_figure
        Whether to return the created figure. Default is ``False``.
    color
        Color of position markers and labels. Default is ``k``. Must be
        a valid Matplotlib color identifier.

    Returns
    -------
    fig
        Created figure, returned if ``return_figure=True``.
