    return_spacing: bool = False,
) -> np.ndarray | tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    """Return indices of a grid evenly spaced in a larger grid of max.
    two dimensions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid_shape
        Tuple of integers or just an integer signifying the number of
        grid indices in each dimension. If 2D, the shape is (n rows,
        n columns).
    nav_shape
        Tuple of integers or just an integer of giving the shape of the
        larger grid. If 2D, the shape is (n rows, n columns).
    return_spacing
        Whether to return the spacing in each dimension. Default is
        ``False``.

    Returns
    -------
    indices
        Array of indices of shape ``(2,) + grid_shape`` or
        ``(1,) + grid_shape`` into the larger grid spanned by
        ``nav_shape``.
    spacing
        The spacing in each dimension. Only returned if
        ``return_spacing=True``.

    --------
