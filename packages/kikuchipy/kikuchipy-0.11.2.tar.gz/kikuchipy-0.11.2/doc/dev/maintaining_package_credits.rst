Maintaining package credits
===========================

Whenever we get a new contributor, with their consent, they should be added to the
package credits.
We maintain two separate sources for the list of contributors:

* ``kikuchipy/__init__.py``: List of contributors `__credits__`
* ``.zenodo.json``: Zenodo entry

In the package metadata and the Zenodo entry, the initial commiter is listed first, with
the others sorted by line contributions.
