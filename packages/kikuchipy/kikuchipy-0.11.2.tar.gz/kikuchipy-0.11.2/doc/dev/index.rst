Contributing
============

kikuchipy is a community maintained project. We welcome contributions in the form of bug
reports, documentation, code, feature requests, and more. The source code is hosted on
`GitHub <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy>`__. These guidelines provide resources on
how best to contribute.

.. tip::

    This guide can look intimidating to people who want to contribute, but have limited
    experience with tools like ``git``, ``pytest``, and ``sphinx``. The shortest route
    to start contributing is to create a GitHub account and explain what you want to do
    `in an issue <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/issues/new>`__.

    That said, our contributing workflow is typical for Python projects, so reading this
    guide can make contributing to similar projects in the future much smoother!

kikuchipy has a :doc:`Code of conduct <code_of_conduct>` that should be honoured by
everyone who participates in the kikuchipy community.

Have a question, comment, suggestion for improvements, or any other inquiries
regarding the project? Feel free to `ask a question
<https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/discussions>`__, `open an issue
<https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/issues>`__ or `make a pull request
<https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pulls>`__ in our GitHub repository. We also have a
`Gitter chat <https://gitter.im/pyxem/kikuchipy>`__.
