## Overview

This module provides an implementation of Whittle's likelihood method to estimate the Hurst exponent of a time series.
The method fits a theoretical spectral density model to the periodogram of the time series realization.
This implementation supports multiple spectral density approximations for fractional Gaussian noise (increments of fractional Brownian motion) and ARFIMA processes.

The Hurst exponent ($H$) controls the roughness, self-similarity, and long-range dependence of fBm paths:

* $H\in(0,0.5):\:$ anti-persistent (mean-reverting) behavior. 
* $H\in(0.5,1):\:$ persistent behavior.
* $H=0.5:\: \mathrm{fBm}(H)$ is the Brownian motion.
* $H\rightarrow 0:\: \mathrm{fBm}(H)\rightarrow$ White noise.
* $H\rightarrow 1:\: \mathrm{fBm}(H)\rightarrow$ Linear trend.

## Features

* Spectral density options:
  - **`fGn`**
  - **`arfima`**
  - `fGn_paxson`
  - `fGn_truncation`
  - `fGn_taylor`
* Flexible interface with an option for a custom spectral density callback.
* Good performance both in terms of speed and accuracy.
* Included generators for fBm and ARFIMA.

## Installation

```
pip install whittlehurst
```

## Usage

### fBm and fGn

```python
import numpy as np
from whittlehurst import whittle, fbm

# Original Hurst value to test with
H=0.42

# Generate an fBm realization
fBm_seq = fbm(H=H, n=10000)

# Calculate the increments (the estimator works with the fGn spectrum)
fGn_seq = np.diff(fBm_seq)

# Estimate the Hurst exponent
H_est = whittle(fGn_seq)

print(f"Original H: {H:0.04f}, estimated H: {H_est:0.04f}")
```

### ARFIMA

```python
import numpy as np
from whittlehurst import whittle, arfima

# Original Hurst value to test with
H=0.42

# Generate an ARFIMA(0, H - 0.5, 0) realization
arfima_seq = arfima(H=H, n=10000)

# No need to take the increments here
# Estimate the "Hurst exponent"
H_est = whittle(arfima_seq, spectrum="arfima")

print(f"Original H: {H:0.04f}, estimated H: {H_est:0.04f}")
```


## Performance


### Compared to other methods

Our Whittle-based estimator offers a compelling alternative to traditional approaches for estimating the Hurst exponent. In particular, we compare it with:

- **R/S Method:** Implemented in the [hurst](https://github.com/Mottl/hurst) package, this method has been widely used for estimating $H$.

- **Higuchi's Method:** Available through the [antropy](https://github.com/raphaelvallat/antropy) package, it performs quite well especially for smaller $H$ values, but its performance drops when $H\rightarrow 1$.

- **Variogram:** Our variogram implementation of order $p = 1$ (madogram) accessible as `from whittlehurst import variogram`.

Inference times indicate per input sequence times, and were calculated as: $t = w\cdot T/k$, where $k=100000$ is the number of sequences, $w=32$ is the number of workers (processing threads), and $T$ is the total elapsed time. Single-thread performance is likely to be better, the results are mainly comparative. 

![Compute Time](https://github.com/aielte-research/whittlehurst/blob/main/tests/plots/fBm_estimators/png/fBm_Hurst_calc_times.png?raw=true  "Compute Time")

The following results were calculated on $100000$ fBm realizations of length $n=1600$.

## Notes

* The default recommended spectral model is `fGn` which relies on Hurwitz's zeta function.
* `fGn_paxson`, `fGn_truncation`, `fGn_taylor` are experimental approximations of the fGn spectrum. 
* For models `fGn_paxson` and `fGn_truncation`, the parameter `K` is configurable (defaults: 50 and 200 respectively).  
* A custom spectral density function may be provided via the `spectrum_callback` parameter.
