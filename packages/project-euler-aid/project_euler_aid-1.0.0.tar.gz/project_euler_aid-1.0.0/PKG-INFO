## project-euler-aid

Hi, I made this package to provide utility functions for solving project euler problems. It can be extended to solve other math problems

Back story - It has been some time I have been solving math problems from different available problem sets. 
A lot of these functions were often needed to solve the problems. I compiled the ones frequently used and decided to publish them. 


## Installation

```
pip install project-euler-aid
```

## Usage

Import the package

```
import project_euler_aid
```
```
from project_euler_aid import get_nth_prime_number

print(get_nth_prime_number(30)) # print the 30th prime number
```
