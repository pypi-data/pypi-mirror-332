# KnowledgeFeed

## Introduction

Welcome to KnowledgeFeed! This is a repository dedicated to curating knowledge on any topic related to your domain. Ever wanted to create your personalised feed of knowledge without wasting countless hours on various social media platforms and research sites? A constant pursuit of knowledge begins here that is intuitive and convinient. 

This package takes in a topic of your interest and creates a feed of posts with caption-sized facts derived from latest research papers and news articles. Along with that, it also returns relevant images, videos and relevant links to know more. You can choose to skim through, or dive deeper. And none of this without concrete citations. You can use this output to build your own knowledge bank. You only need to handle personalisation to the topics in the frontend. 

Happy learning!
