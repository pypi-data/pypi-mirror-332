Sync Toolbox: A Python Package for Efficient, Robust, and Accurate Music Synchronization
========================================================================================
**Sync Toolbox** is a Python package, which comprises all components of a music synchronization
pipeline that is robust, efficient, and accurate.

The toolbox's core technology is based on dynamic time warping (DTW). Using suitable feature representations
and cost measures, DTW brings the feature sequences into temporal correspondence. To account for efficiency,
robustness, and accuracy, **Sync Toolbox** uses a combination of
`multiscale DTW (MsDTW) <https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/content/05-fau/professor/00-mueller/03-publications/2006_MuellerMattesKurth_MultiscaleAudioSynchronization_ISMIR.pdf>`__,
`memory-restricted MsDTW (MrMsDTW) <https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/content/05-fau/professor/00-mueller/03-publications/2016_PraetzlichDriedgerMueller_MrMsDTW_ICASSP.pdf>`__,
and `high-resolution music synchronization <https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/content/05-fau/professor/00-mueller/03-publications/2009_EwertMuellerGrosche_HighResAudioSync_ICASSP.pdf>`__.

Despite a slight overlap with the well-known software packages in the MIR field (e.g., librosa and linmdtw),
our **Sync Toolbox** is the first to provide an open-source Python package for offline music synchronization
that produces state-of-the-art alignment results regarding efficiency and accuracy.
