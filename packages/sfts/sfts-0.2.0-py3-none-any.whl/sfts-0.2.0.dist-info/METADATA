Short Fourier Transforms for Fresnel-weighted Template Summation.

Implementation of gravitational-wave data-analysis tools described in [Tenorio & Gerosa (2025)][sfts]
to operate using Short Fourier Transforms (SFTs).

See the [examples](./examples) for a quick-start on using SFTs and [`iphenot`][iphenot] (`/ˈaɪv ˈnɒt/`).

`sfts` contains two main modules:

1. [kernels.py](./src/sfts/kernels.py): Fresnel and Dirichlet kernels to compute scalar products using SFTs.
1. [iphenot.py][iphenot]: [jaxified](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax) re-implementation of the
inspiral part of the  [`IMRPhenomT` waveform approximant][LALPhenomT].

The SFT convention in this package is compatible with that in the
[LVK  `.sft` file format](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-T040164/public). 
Checkout [fasttracks](https://github.com/Rodrigo-Tenorio/sfts)'
[search example](https://github.com/Rodrigo-Tenorio/fasttracks/blob/master/examples/run_binary_search.py) 
to learn about reading `.sft` files into `jax` arrays.

# How to install

`sfts` can be pulled in from PyPI:
```
$ pip install sfts
```

To pull in `jax`'s GPU capabilities, use:

```
$ pip install sfts[cuda]
```

Alternatively, this repository itself is pip-installable.
