# `hi-chem`: H.i.'s Cheminformatic Python Package

This a package of functions and classes that I've developed over time -- 
hopefully it can be of some use to others!
Check out my blog at [harmsinformatics.org](https://harmsinformatics.org) for examples and tips when using this repo.

## Functionality
`hi-chem` currently supports the following functionality:
- SMILES canonicalization
- Low energy conformer generation

## Installing
Installation is really easy, just run:
```angular2html
pip install hi-chem
```

This package will require `rdkit`, `py3Dmol`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
