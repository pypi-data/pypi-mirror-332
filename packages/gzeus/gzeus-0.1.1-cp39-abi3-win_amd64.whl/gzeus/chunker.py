        buffer_size
            Buffer size in bytes. 1_000_000 is 1MB. A min of 1MB is used for this value.
            Note: in fact, the actual buffer that will get allocated has size slightly
            greater than the given value. Actual chunk size will vary depending on the compression, 
            but this buffer will be used repeatedly in the process, saving overall memory.
        new_line_symbol
            The symbol for new line. The last such symbol indicates the end of the 
            chunk. And the rest of the bytes will be appended to the front of the next
            chunk of bytes read.
