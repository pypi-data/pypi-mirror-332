log_file = edger.log                            # Log file location
icon_path = edger.ico                           # Path to system tray icon
jiggler_interval = 30                           # Seconds between mouse jiggle actions
detection_interval = 1                          # Seconds between checks for new Edge windows
default_jiggle = off                            # Start with jiggler enabled (on/off)
default_redirect = on                           # Start with redirection enabled (on/off)

[Bypass]
urls = statics.teams.cdn.office.net, example.com/redirect  # URLs to ignore
```

### Options Explained

| Setting | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `search_engine_url` | The search engine that replaces Bing (with query parameter) |
| `log_file` | Location for storing redirect logs |
| `icon_path` | Custom icon for the system tray |
| `jiggler_interval` | How often (in seconds) the mouse jiggler simulates activity |
| `detection_interval` | How often (in seconds) Edger checks for new Edge windows |
| `default_jiggle` | Whether the mouse jiggler is enabled at startup (on/off) |
| `default_redirect` | Whether Edge redirection is enabled at startup (on/off) |
| `urls` (in Bypass) | Comma-separated list of URLs that should not be redirected |

> **Note:** The bypass list is especially important for Microsoft Teams URLs which require special handling to work correctly.

## üîß Usage

Once running, Edger sits in your system tray (notification area) and works automatically:

1. When Edge opens, Edger captures the URL
2. The URL is processed (converted if it's a Bing search)
3. Your default browser opens with the same/converted URL
4. The Edge window is closed
5. The activity is logged for reference

### System Tray Controls

- **Left-click**: Access the menu
- **Redirect Edge Windows**: Toggle Edge redirection on or off
- **Mouse Jiggler**: Toggle the invisible mouse activity simulator
- **Settings**: Open the settings GUI to adjust intervals and default states
- **View Log**: Open the log file in your default text editor
- **Edit Config**: Open the config.ini file directly in your text editor
- **Exit**: Close the application

### Settings GUI

Edger includes a graphical settings panel accessible from the system tray menu. This allows you to easily configure:

- **Mouse Jiggle Interval**: How often (in seconds) the mouse jiggler simulates activity
- **Edge Detection Interval**: How often (in seconds) Edger checks for new Edge windows
- **Default States**: Whether features are enabled by default at startup

Changes made through the Settings GUI are saved to the config.ini file and applied immediately.

### Mouse Jiggler

The built-in mouse jiggler simulates mouse activity without actually moving your cursor. This prevents your computer from:
- Going to sleep
- Activating the screen saver
- Showing as "Away" or "Inactive" in messaging apps
- Triggering automatic locks

The jiggler is completely invisible - your cursor won't move on screen, but Windows will detect "activity".
