# Power Calculation Routines for GWAS Study Design

This is a library to quickly calculate power curves for the expected detected effect in Genome-Wide Association Studies.

## Installation

If you are interested in installing this package for direct use within scripts or notebooks, please run:

```
pip install qtl-power
```

## Interactive Exploration via Notebooks

If you are primarily interested in a more interactive experience, you can immediately use several of our pre-built notebooks via the [`mybinder`](https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/data-analysis5%2Fqtl-power/default?labpath=notebooks%2F) link above. This will allow you to use the library to generate commonly used plots for comparing power for genetic association based on mutliple input parameters.

## Documentation

Currently the documentaton is held in the `/docs` directory and is built using [`Sphinx`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). To rebuild the documentation:

```
cd docsrc
make clean html copy
cd ..
git add docs/
```

then create a commit that will create an updated set of documentation.
