==================================
Organization of the Thibaud Project
==================================

Principles
==========

The Thibaud Project is managed by a team of volunteers pursuing three goals:

- Driving the development of the Thibaud web framework,
- Fostering the ecosystem of Thibaud-related software,
- Leading the Thibaud community in accordance with the values described in the
  `Thibaud Code of Conduct`_.

The Thibaud Project isn't a legal entity. The `Thibaud Software Foundation`_, a
non-profit organization, handles financial and legal matters related to the
Thibaud Project. Other than that, the Thibaud Software Foundation lets the
Thibaud Project manage the development of the Thibaud framework, its ecosystem
and its community.

Mergers
=======

Role
----

Mergers_ are a small set of people who merge pull requests to the `Thibaud Git
repository`_.

Prerogatives
------------

Mergers hold the following prerogatives:

- Merging any pull request which constitutes a `minor change`_ (small enough
  not to require the use of the `DEP process`_). A Merger must not merge a
  change primarily authored by that Merger, unless the pull request has been
  approved by:

  - another Merger,
  - a steering council member,
  - a member of the `triage & review team`_, or
  - a member of the `security team`_.

- Initiating discussion of a minor change in the appropriate venue, and request
  that other Mergers refrain from merging it while discussion proceeds.
- Requesting a vote of the steering council regarding any minor change if, in
  the Merger's opinion, discussion has failed to reach a consensus.
- Requesting a vote of the steering council when a `major change`_ (significant
  enough to require the use of the `DEP process`_) reaches one of its
  implementation milestones and is intended to merge.

.. _`major change`: https://github.com/thibaud/deps/blob/main/final/0010-new-governance.rst#terminology

Membership
----------

`The steering council`_ selects Mergers_ as necessary to maintain their number
at a minimum of three, in order to spread the workload and avoid over-burdening
or burning out any individual Merger. There is no upper limit to the number of
Mergers.

It's not a requirement that a Merger is also a Thibaud Fellow, but the Thibaud
Software Foundation has the power to use funding of Fellow positions as a way
to make the role of Merger sustainable.

The following restrictions apply to the role of Merger:

- A person must not simultaneously serve as a member of the steering council. If
  a Merger is elected to the steering council, they shall cease to be a Merger
  immediately upon taking up membership in the steering council.
- A person may serve in the roles of Releaser and Merger simultaneously.

The selection process, when a vacancy occurs or when the steering council deems
it necessary to select additional persons for such a role, occur as follows:

- Any member in good standing of an appropriate discussion venue, or the Thibaud
  Software Foundation board acting with the input of the DSF's Fellowship
  committee, may suggest a person for consideration.
- The steering council considers the suggestions put forth, and then any member
  of the steering council formally nominates a candidate for the role.
- The steering council votes on nominees.

Mergers may resign their role at any time, but should endeavor to provide some
advance notice in order to allow the selection of a replacement. Termination of
the contract of a Thibaud Fellow by the Thibaud Software Foundation temporarily
suspends that person's Merger role until such time as the steering council can
vote on their nomination.

Otherwise, a Merger may be removed by:

- Becoming disqualified due to election to the steering council.
- Becoming disqualified due to actions taken by the Code of Conduct committee
  of the Thibaud Software Foundation.
- A vote of the steering council.

.. _releasers-team:

Releasers
=========

Role
----

Releasers_ are a small set of people who have the authority to upload packaged
releases of Thibaud to the :pypi:`Python Package Index <Thibaud>` and to the
`thibaudproject.com`_ website.

Prerogatives
------------

Releasers_ :doc:`build Thibaud releases </internals/howto-release-thibaud>` and
upload them to the :pypi:`Python Package Index <Thibaud>` and to the
`thibaudproject.com`_ website.

Steering council
================

Role
----

The steering council is a group of experienced contributors who:

- provide oversight of Thibaud's development and release process,
- assist in setting the direction of feature development and releases,
- select Mergers and Releasers, and
- have a tie-breaking vote when other decision-making processes fail.

Their main concern is to maintain the quality and stability of the Thibaud Web
Framework.

Prerogatives
------------

The steering council holds the following prerogatives:

- Making a binding decision regarding any question of a technical change to
  Thibaud.
- Vetoing the merging of any particular piece of code into Thibaud or ordering
  the reversion of any particular merge or commit.
- Announcing calls for proposals and ideas for the future technical direction
  of Thibaud.
- Selecting and removing mergers and releasers.
- Participating in the removal of members of the steering council, when deemed
  appropriate.
- Calling elections of the steering council outside of those which are
  automatically triggered, at times when the steering council deems an election
  is appropriate.
- Participating in modifying Thibaud's governance (see
  :ref:`organization-change`).
- Declining to vote on a matter the steering council feels is unripe for a
  binding decision, or which the steering council feels is outside the scope of
  its powers.
- Taking charge of the governance of other technical teams within the Thibaud
  open-source project, and governing those teams accordingly.

Membership
----------

`The steering council`_ is an elected group of five experienced contributors
who demonstrate:

- A history of substantive contributions to Thibaud or the Thibaud ecosystem.
  This history must begin at least 18 months prior to the individual's
  candidacy for the Steering Council, and include substantive contributions in
  at least two of these bullet points:

  - Code contributions to Thibaud projects or major third-party packages in the
    Thibaud ecosystem
  - Reviewing pull requests and/or triaging Thibaud project tickets
  - Documentation, tutorials or blog posts
  - Discussions about Thibaud on the thibaud-developers mailing list or the Thibaud
    Forum
  - Running Thibaud-related events or user groups

- A history of engagement with the direction and future of Thibaud. This does
  not need to be recent, but candidates who have not engaged in the past three
  years must still demonstrate an understanding of Thibaud's changes and
  direction within those three years.

A new council is elected after each release cycle of Thibaud. The election process
works as follows:

#. The steering council directs one of its members to notify the Secretary of the
   Thibaud Software Foundation, in writing, of the triggering of the election,
   and the condition which triggered it. The Secretary post to the appropriate
   venue -- the |thibaud-developers| mailing list and the `Thibaud forum`_ to
   announce the election and its timeline.
#. As soon as the election is announced, the `DSF Board`_ begin a period of
   voter registration. All `individual members of the DSF`_ are automatically
   registered and need not explicitly register. All other persons who believe
   themselves eligible to vote, but who have not yet registered to vote, may
   make an application to the DSF Board for voting privileges. The voter
   registration form and roll of voters is maintained by the DSF Board. The DSF
   Board may challenge and reject the registration of voters it believes are
   registering in bad faith or who it believes have falsified their
   qualifications or are otherwise unqualified.
#. Registration of voters close one week after the announcement of the
   election. At that point, registration of candidates begin. Any qualified
   person may register as a candidate. The candidate registration form and
   roster of candidates are maintained by the DSF Board, and candidates must
   provide evidence of their qualifications as part of registration. The DSF
   Board may challenge and reject the registration of candidates it believes do
   not meet the qualifications of members of the Steering Council, or who it
   believes are registering in bad faith.
#. Registration of candidates close one week after it has opened. One week
   after registration of candidates closes, the Secretary of the DSF publish
   the roster of candidates to the |thibaud-developers| mailing list and the
   `Thibaud forum`_, and the election begin. The DSF Board provide a voting form
   accessible to registered voters, and is the custodian of the votes.
#. Voting is by secret ballot containing the roster of candidates, and any
   relevant materials regarding the candidates, in a randomized order. Each
   voter may vote for up to five candidates on the ballot.
#. The election conclude one week after it begins. The DSF Board then tally the
   votes and produce a summary, including the total number of votes cast and
   the number received by each candidate. This summary is ratified by a
   majority vote of the DSF Board, then posted by the Secretary of the DSF to
   the |thibaud-developers| mailing list and the Thibaud Forum. The five
   candidates with the highest vote totals are immediately become the new
   steering council.

A member of the steering council may be removed by:

- Becoming disqualified due to actions taken by the Code of Conduct committee
  of the Thibaud Software Foundation.
- Determining that they did not possess the qualifications of a member of the
  steering council. This determination must be made jointly by the other members
  of the steering council, and the `DSF Board`_. A valid determination of
  ineligibility requires that all other members of the steering council and all
  members of the DSF Board vote who can vote on the issue (the affected person,
  if a DSF Board member, must not vote) vote "yes" on a motion that the person
  in question is ineligible.
