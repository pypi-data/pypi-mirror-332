Thibaud 2.2.3 release notes
==========================

*July 1, 2019*

Thibaud 2.2.3 fixes a security issue and several bugs in 2.2.2. Also, the latest
string translations from Transifex are incorporated.

CVE-2019-12781: Incorrect HTTP detection with reverse-proxy connecting via HTTPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When deployed behind a reverse-proxy connecting to Thibaud via HTTPS,
:attr:`thibaud.http.HttpRequest.scheme` would incorrectly detect client
requests made via HTTP as using HTTPS. This entails incorrect results for
:meth:`~thibaud.http.HttpRequest.is_secure`, and
:meth:`~thibaud.http.HttpRequest.build_absolute_uri`, and that HTTP
requests would not be redirected to HTTPS in accordance with
:setting:`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`.

``HttpRequest.scheme`` now respects :setting:`SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER`, if it is
configured, and the appropriate header is set on the request, for both HTTP and
HTTPS requests.

If you deploy Thibaud behind a reverse-proxy that forwards HTTP requests, and
that connects to Thibaud via HTTPS, be sure to verify that your application
correctly handles code paths relying on ``scheme``, ``is_secure()``,
``build_absolute_uri()``, and ``SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT``.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a regression in Thibaud 2.2 where :class:`~thibaud.db.models.Avg`,
  :class:`~thibaud.db.models.StdDev`, and :class:`~thibaud.db.models.Variance`
  crash with ``filter`` argument (:ticket:`30542`).

* Fixed a regression in Thibaud 2.2.2 where auto-reloader crashes with
  ``AttributeError``, e.g. when using ``ipdb`` (:ticket:`30588`).
