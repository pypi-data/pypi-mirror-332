Thibaud 3.0.13 release notes
===========================

*February 19, 2021*

Thibaud 3.0.13 fixes a security issue in 3.0.12.

CVE-2021-23336: Web cache poisoning via ``thibaud.utils.http.limited_parse_qsl()``
=================================================================================

Thibaud contains a copy of :func:`urllib.parse.parse_qsl` which was added to
backport some security fixes. A further security fix has been issued recently
such that ``parse_qsl()`` no longer allows using ``;`` as a query parameter
separator by default. Thibaud now includes this fix. See :bpo:`42967` for
further details.
