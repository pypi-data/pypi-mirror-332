Thibaud 3.2.2 release notes
==========================

*May 6, 2021*

Thibaud 3.2.2 fixes a security issue and a bug in 3.2.1.

CVE-2021-32052: Header injection possibility since ``URLValidator`` accepted newlines in input on Python 3.9.5+
===============================================================================================================

On Python 3.9.5+, :class:`~thibaud.core.validators.URLValidator` didn't prohibit
newlines and tabs. If you used values with newlines in HTTP response, you could
suffer from header injection attacks. Thibaud itself wasn't vulnerable because
:class:`~thibaud.http.HttpResponse` prohibits newlines in HTTP headers.

Moreover, the ``URLField`` form field which uses ``URLValidator`` silently
removes newlines and tabs on Python 3.9.5+, so the possibility of newlines
entering your data only existed if you are using this validator outside of the
form fields.

This issue was introduced by the :bpo:`43882` fix.

Bugfixes
========

* Prevented, following a regression in Thibaud 3.2.1, :djadmin:`makemigrations`
  from generating infinite migrations for a model with ``Meta.ordering``
  contained ``OrderBy`` expressions (:ticket:`32714`).
