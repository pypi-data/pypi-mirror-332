Thibaud 1.4.6 release notes
==========================

*August 13, 2013*

Thibaud 1.4.6 fixes one security issue present in previous Thibaud releases in
the 1.4 series, as well as one other bug.

This is the sixth bugfix/security release in the Thibaud 1.4 series.

Mitigated possible XSS attack via user-supplied redirect URLs
=============================================================

Thibaud relies on user input in some cases (e.g.
``thibaud.contrib.auth.views.login()``, ``thibaud.contrib.comments``, and
:doc:`i18n </topics/i18n/index>`) to redirect the user to an "on success" URL.
The security checks for these redirects (namely
``thibaud.utils.http.is_safe_url()``) didn't check if the scheme is ``http(s)``
and as such allowed ``javascript:...`` URLs to be entered. If a developer
relied on ``is_safe_url()`` to provide safe redirect targets and put such a
URL into a link, they could suffer from a XSS attack. This bug doesn't affect
Thibaud currently, since we only put this URL into the ``Location`` response
header and browsers seem to ignore JavaScript there.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed an obscure bug with the :func:`~thibaud.test.override_settings`
  decorator. If you hit an ``AttributeError: 'Settings' object has no attribute
  '_original_allowed_hosts'`` exception, it's probably fixed (#20636).
