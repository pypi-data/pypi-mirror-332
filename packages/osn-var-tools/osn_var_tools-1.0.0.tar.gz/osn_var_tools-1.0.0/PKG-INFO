## Usage Examples

The following examples illustrate a small subset of osn-var-tools’ capabilities. Refer to the detailed documentation for more comprehensive examples and usage instructions.

**Formatting pandas.DataFrame:**

```python
# Formatting
from osn_var_tools.format_tools import format_data_frame
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2.5, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]})
formatted_df = format_data_frame(df)
print(formatted_df)
```

**Yielding datetime in range:**

```python
# Date Manipulation
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from osn_var_tools.var_utilities import date_range
start = datetime(2024, 1, 1)
end = datetime(2024, 1, 5)
delta = timedelta(days=1)

for date in date_range(start, end, delta):
	print(date)
```
