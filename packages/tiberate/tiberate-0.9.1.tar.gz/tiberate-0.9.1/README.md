# What is this

this is a variant of [Desilo/liberate-fhe](https://github.com/Desilo/liberate-fhe) with better typing (and for my own modifications). This fork has left fork network and will not return to the original branch.

## Install

```bash
pip install tiberate --verbose
```

## Install from source

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wens-lab/tiberate-fhe.git
cd tiberate-fhe
# install the dependencies
poetry install # this will also install the package itself into current environment
```
