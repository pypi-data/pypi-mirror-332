## project-euler-utils

Hi, I made this package to provide utility functions for solving project euler problems. It can be extended to solve math problems

Back story - It has been some time I have been solving math problems from different available problem sets. 
A lot of these functions were frequently needed to solve the problems. I compiled the ones frequently used and decided to publish them. 


## Installation

```
pip install project-euler-utils
```

## Usage

Import the package

```
import project_euler_utils
```

## Contributing

I will massively appreciate your contributions in developing this package alongside.
Please refer to CONTRIBUTING.md for the details
