title: Interfaces
---

A module can adopt a public interface by matching interface rules in [`tach.toml`](./configuration#interfaces).

## How does it work?

When Tach is checking imports from a module with a [public interface](./configuration#interfaces), it will verify that the import matches one of the `expose` patterns.
This prevents other modules from becoming coupled to implementation details, and makes future changes easier.

## Example

Given modules called 'core' and 'domain', we may have `tach.toml` contents like this:

```toml
[[modules]]
path = "domain"
depends_on = [
    "core"
]

[[modules]]
path = "core"
depends_on = []

[[interfaces]]
expose = ["get_data"]
from = ["core"]
```

Then, in `domain.py`, we may have:

```python
from core.main import DataModel  # This import fails

DataModel.objects.all()
```

This import would **fail** `tach check` with the following error:

```shell
❌ domain.py[L1]: Module 'core' has a public interface. Only imports from the public interface of this module are allowed. The import 'core.main.DataModel' (in module 'parsing') is not public.
```

In this case, there is a public interface defined in `tach.toml` which includes a service method to use instead.

```python
from core import get_data  # This import is OK

get_data()
```

`tach check` will now pass!

```bash
✅ All modules validated!
```
