Introduction
============
**Snptools** is a tool for SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) data processing,
parentage calculation and call rate estimation.

SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) represent genetic variations, that can
be used to analyze genetic data. SNPTools provides a set of tools for working
with SNP data, including the following capabilities:

- Processing the Finalreport.txt file in Dataframe.
- Preparation of data in plink and snp(blupf90) formats.
- Parentage Verification and Parentage Discovery Based on SNP Genotypes (ICAR).
- Call rate estimation (percentage of missing data).
- Allele frequency, minor allele frequency (MAF).
- Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
