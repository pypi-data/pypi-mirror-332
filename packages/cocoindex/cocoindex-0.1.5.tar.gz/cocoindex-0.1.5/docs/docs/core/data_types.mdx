# Data Types in CocoIndex

In CocoIndex, all data processed by the flow have a type determined when the flow is defined, before any actual data is processed at runtime.

This makes schema of data processed by CocoIndex clear, and easily determine the schema of your index.

## Basic Types

This is the list of all basic types supported by CocoIndex:

| Type | Type in Python | Original Type in Python |
|------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| `bytes` | `bytes` | `bytes` |
| `str` | `str` | `str` |
| `bool` | `bool` | `bool` |
| `int64` | `int` | `int` |
| `float32` | `cocoindex.typing.Float32` |`float` | 
| `float64` |  `cocoindex.typing.Float64` |`float` |
| `range` | `cocoindex.typing.Range`  | `tuple[int, int]` |
| `vector(*type* [, *N*])` |`Annotated[list[type], cocoindex.typing.Vector(dim=N)]` | `list[type]` | 
| `json` | `cocoindex.typing.Json` | Any type convertible to JSON by `json` package | 

For some types, CocoIndex Python SDK provides annotated types with finer granularity than Python's original type, e.g. `Float32` and `Float64` for `float`, and `vector` has dimension information.

When defining [custom functions](/docs/core/custom_function), use the specific types as type annotations for arguments and return values.
So CocoIndex will have information about the specific type.

## Composite Types

Note: CocoIndex will support functions taking composite types as arguments or returning composite types soon.
We'll update this section with corresponding Python types by then.

### Struct

A struct has a bunch of fields, each with a name and a type.

### Table

A table has a collection of rows, each of which is a struct with specified schema.

The first field of a table is always the primary key.
