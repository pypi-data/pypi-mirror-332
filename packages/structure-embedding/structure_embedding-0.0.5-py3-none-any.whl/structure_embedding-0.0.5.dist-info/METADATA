## Structure embedding

`structure-embedding` is a lightweight package that streamlines dimensionality 
reduction for materials-based feature vectors by seamlessly managing data 
subsets for efficient analysis.

## Implemented algorithms
- UMAP

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install -q structure-embedding
```
