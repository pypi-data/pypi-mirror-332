# ncrystal-plugin-GraphiticData

## Generation of ncmat files

### Graphite oxides and fullerite

The NCMAT files of graphite oxides and fullerite (C60) are generated by Shuqi Xu
on behalf of the Work Package 2 of the HighNESS project using the NCrystal tool
NCMATComposer.

The cif file and the phonon density of states (PDOS) are provided by Marco
Bernasconi and Debdipto Acharya from Universit√† di Milano-Bicocca.

### Graphite intercalation compounds

The NCMAT files of graphite oxides and fullerite (C60) are generated by Douglas
D. DiJulio on behalf of the Work Package 2 of the HighNESS project using the
NCrystal tool NCMATComposer.

The CIF files are from Material Project and the Debye model is used for PDOS.
