"""
This module establishes the main structure for creating agent instances within the MonkAI framework. 

It provides an abstract class, 'MonkaiAgentCreator', which serves as a blueprint for developing various types of agents, ensuring that all subclasses implement the essential methods for agent creation and description. Additionally, it includes a concrete class, 'TransferTriageAgentCreator', which extends 'MonkaiAgentCreator' and implements specific logic for creating and managing a triage agent.
