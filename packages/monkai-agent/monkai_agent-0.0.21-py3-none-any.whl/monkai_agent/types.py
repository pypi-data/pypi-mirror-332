"""
This module defines the data types and models used by the MonkAI agent. It includes class and type definitions that represent the agent's functions, processable messages, instructions, and associated models. 

These definitions play a crucial role in ensuring data consistency and validation, facilitating maintenance and seamless scalability of the codebase.
