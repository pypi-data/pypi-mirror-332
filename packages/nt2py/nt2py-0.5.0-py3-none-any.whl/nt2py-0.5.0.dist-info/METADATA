## nt2.py

Python package for visualization and post-processing of the [`Entity`](https://github.com/entity-toolkit/entity) simulation data. For usage, please refer to the [documentation](https://entity-toolkit.github.io/wiki/getting-started/vis/#nt2py). The package is distributed via [`PyPI`](https://pypi.org/project/nt2py/):

```sh
pip install nt2py
```

### Usage

The Library works both with single-file output as well as with separate files. In either case, the location of the data is passed via `path` keyword argument.

```python
import nt2

data = nt2.Data(path="path/to/data")
# example: 
#   data = nt2.Data(path="path/to/shock.h5") : for single-file
#   data = nt2.Data(path="path/to/shock") : for multi-file
```

The data is stored in specialized containers which can be accessed via corresponding attributes:

```python
data.fields     # < xr.Dataset
data.particles  # < dict[int : xr.Dataset]
data.spectra    # < xr.Dataset
```

#### Examples

Plot a field (in cartesian space) at a specific time (or output step):

```python
data.fields.Ex.sel(t=10.0, method="nearest").plot() # time ~ 10
data.fields.Ex.isel(t=5).plot()                     # output step = 5
```

Plot a slice or time-averaged field quantities:

```python
data.fields.Bz.mean("t").plot()
data.fields.Bz.sel(t=10.0, x=0.5, method="nearest").plot()
```

Plot in spherical coordinates (+ combine several fields):

```python
e_dot_b = (data.fields.Er * data.fields.Br +\
           data.fields.Eth * data.fields.Bth +\
           data.fields.Eph * data.fields.Bph)
bsqr = data.fields.Br**2 + data.fields.Bth**2 + data.fields.Bph**2
# only plot radial extent of up to 10
(e_dot_b / bsqr).sel(t=50.0, method="nearest").sel(r=slice(None, 10)).polar.pcolor()
```

You can also quickly plot the fields at a specific time using the handy `.inspect` accessor:

```python
data.fields\
    .sel(t=3.0, method="nearest")\
    .sel(x=slice(-0.2, 0.2))\
    .inspect.plot(only_fields=["E", "B"])
# Hint: use `<...>.plot?` to see all options
```

Or if no time is specified, it will create a quick movie (need to also provide a `name` in that case):

```python
data.fields\
    .sel(x=slice(-0.2, 0.2))\
    .inspect.plot(name="inspect", only_fields=["E", "B", "N"])
```

You can also create a movie of a single field quantity (can be custom):

```python
(data.fields.Ex * data.fields.Bx).sel(x=slice(None, 0.2)).movie.plot(name="ExBx", vmin=-0.01, vmax=0.01, cmap="BrBG")
```

You may also combine different quantities and plots (e.g., fields & particles) to produce a more customized movie:

```python
def plot(t, data):
    fig, ax = mpl.pyplot.subplots()
    data.fields.Ex.sel(t=t, method="nearest").sel(x=slice(None, 0.2)).plot(
        ax=ax, vmin=-0.001, vmax=0.001, cmap="BrBG"
    )
    for sp in range(1, 3):
        ax.scatter(
            data.particles[sp].sel(t=t, method="nearest").x,
            data.particles[sp].sel(t=t, method="nearest").y,
            c="r" if sp == 1 else "b",
        )
    ax.set_aspect(1)
data.makeMovie(plot)
```

> If using Jupyter notebook, you can quickly preview the loaded metadata by simply running a cell with just `data` in it (or in regular python, by doing `print(data)`).

### Dashboard

Support for the dask dashboard is still in beta, but you can access it by first launching the dashboard client:

```python
import nt2 
nt2.Dashboard()
```

This will output the port where the dashboard server is running, e.g., `Dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:8787/status`. Click on it (or enter in your browser) to open the dashboard.

### Features

1. Lazy loading and parallel processing of the simulation data with [`dask`](https://dask.org/).
2. Context-aware data manipulation with [`xarray`](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/).
3. Parellel plotting and movie generation with [`multiprocessing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) and [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/).

### TODO

- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Plugins for other simulation data formats
- [x] Usage examples
