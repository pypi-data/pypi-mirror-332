"""
This test file is intentionally empty.

The automated metadata extraction functionality has been removed from the core MDP package
and moved to the Datapack platform.

- extract_metadata_from_content function in utils.py
- auto_enhance_metadata method in Document class

This is part of the effort to keep the MDP package focused on the core specification
with minimal dependencies.
