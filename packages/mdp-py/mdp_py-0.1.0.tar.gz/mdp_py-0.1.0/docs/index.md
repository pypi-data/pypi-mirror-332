# Markdown Data Pack (MDP)

**A global standard file specification for document management with context and relationships.**

## The Problem

In today's AI ecosystem, document management faces critical challenges:

- **Context Loss**: Documents lose their context when processed by LLMs
- **Relationship Blindness**: Connections between related documents are not easily accessible
- **Duplication Waste**: Systems repeatedly parse the same documents to understand their structure
- **Split Formats**: Either human-readable OR machine-processable, rarely both
- **Metadata Isolation**: Important metadata is often separated from content

Current document formats force a trade-off between human-friendliness and machine-processability, leading to inefficient document usage by LLMs and forcing systems to duplicate work.

## The Solution: MDP

MDP (Markdown Data Pack) is a simple yet powerful file format that combines:

- **Human-Readable Markdown Content**: Familiar and easy to edit
- **Structured Metadata**: Essential information in YAML frontmatter
- **Document Relationships**: Explicit links to related documents
- **Context Preservation**: Keep important context with the content
- **Unified Format**: Single file that works for both humans and machines

## Key Benefits

- **Efficiency**: LLMs process documents more effectively with embedded context
- **Relationships**: Documents explicitly reference related information
- **Simplicity**: Single `.mdp` file format instead of multiple files
- **Compatibility**: Works with existing markdown and YAML tools
- **Extensibility**: Custom metadata fields for specialized use cases
