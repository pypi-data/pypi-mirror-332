### [Solving the Document Context Problem for AI with MDP](solving-context-problem.md)

*February 28, 2024*

In today's AI ecosystem, one of the most significant challenges is maintaining document context and relationships. When documents are processed by Large Language Models (LLMs), crucial information about their purpose, origin, and relationships to other documents is often lost. This leads to inefficient use of documents and duplicative processing work.

This post explores how MDP's approach to document context and relationships makes it an ideal format for AI-driven document processing systems.
