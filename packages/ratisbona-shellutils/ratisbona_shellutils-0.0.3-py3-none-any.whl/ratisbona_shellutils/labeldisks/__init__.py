    This modules scans for hard drives and gathers the logical volumes they contain
    and the contents of the mount points if they are mounted.
    It can be used to print out labels for those hard drives, which is very handy, as soon as you have
    docking bays with multiple hard drives in them or as soon as you take your server apart.
