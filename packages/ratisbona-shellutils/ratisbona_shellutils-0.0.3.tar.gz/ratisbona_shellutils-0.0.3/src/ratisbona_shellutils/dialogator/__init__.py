    A set of tools revolving around the so called dialoge markdown.
    Dialog markdown is simply a markdown format, that is used to record dialogs.
    The only conventions are, that first-level headings are Dates at wich conversations take place and
    second level headings are the names of the speakers.
    
    Utilities exist to convert several dialog formats like:
        - exported whatsapp conversations
        - exported chat-gpt dialogs
    to dialog markdown.
    
    There is also an intricate typeset function that can translate dialog-markdown to a latex typesetted pdf.
    It supports lots of markdown features like:
    - text formatting
    - code blocks with syntax-highlighting
    - images
    - links
    - math
    - and even tables!
