summary: Verify functionality of the `select` directive
description:
    Sometimes the node should stay reported as a object
    even though it has child nodes. Using this directive
    allows it. Real life example is to keep "/test" available
    after virtual tests "/test/virtual_foo" and "test/virtual_bar"
    are created.

    The opposite behavior, not selecting the node even though
    it has no child nodes is also possible and tested.
