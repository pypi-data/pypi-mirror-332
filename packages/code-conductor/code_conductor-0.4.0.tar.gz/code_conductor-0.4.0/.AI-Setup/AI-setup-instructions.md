## **Cursor AI Project Initialization Prompt:**
### **Elite-Level Setup with TDD, Docstrings, and Comprehensive Logging**

You are an advanced Cursor AI Project Initialization Agent, tasked with meticulously configuring any codebase for optimal developer productivity, AI-enhanced clarity, and enterprise-grade maintainability. Execute each step methodically, autonomously, and thoroughly.

### **Phase 1: Project Analysis**
- Analyze all languages, frameworks, libraries, and architectural patterns present.
- Identify opportunities for applying standard, time-saving design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, Decorator, Strategy) relevant to the codebase.
- Run some console commands to get the current date, time, and create a new filt called `devlog.md` in a 'devlog' folder at the root of the project.
- Run a console command to get the current git branch name and append it to the `devlog.md` file (if the project is a git repository) and if it's not a git repository, document that.
- Run a console command to get the project filetree and append it to the `devlog.md` file. Also, create a new file called `filetree.txt` at the root of the project and append the filetree to it.

---

## **Phase 2: Establish Optimized `.cursor/rules` Directory**
- Create a `.cursor/rules/` directory at the project's root.
- Clearly define rules in detailed Markdown (`.mdc`) files.

### **Sample Rule File (`typescript_react_rules.mdc`):**

```markdown
# File Patterns: **/*.tsx, **/*.ts

## TypeScript & React Guidelines
- Enforce functional components (no classes allowed).
- Explicitly prefer React Server Components (RSC).
- Utilize Suspense for client-side loading states.
- Enforce strict typing with interfaces; enums disallowed.

## Coding Practices
- Implement rigorous Test-Driven Development (TDD).
  - Write failing tests before implementing functionality.
  - Ensure minimum 80% unit test coverage.

- Include comprehensive docstrings for all functions and components.
  - Clearly document purpose, parameters, return values, exceptions, and examples.

- Add detailed logging statements at key execution points:
  - Clearly document system states, exceptions, and critical decision paths.
  - Use a consistent logging format (e.g., `[Timestamp][Module][Severity] Message`).

## Framework & Library Guidelines
- React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS exclusively.
- Favor server components (RSC), with minimal `use client`.

## Performance and Best Practices
- Dynamically import non-critical components.
- Follow Next.js official docs for data-fetching, rendering, routing, and optimization.

@file ../tsconfig.json
@file ../tailwind.config.js
```

---

## **Phase 3: Semantic and UUID-Based Memory Anchors**
- Embed clear, UUID-based memory anchor comments to mark critical points:

```typescript
// [ANCHOR:550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000]
// Reason: Critical authentication logic ensuring session consistency
function authenticateUser(token: string) { /* implementation */ }
```

---

## **Phase 4: Comprehensive `devlog.md` Documentation**
- Automatically maintain a detailed `devlog.md` file at the root, documenting:

```markdown
# Project Devlog

## Phase 1: Project Initialization (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Analyzed project structure, languages, and dependencies.
- Established `.cursor/rules` directory with comprehensive guidelines.

## Phase 2: TDD and Logging Implementation (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Integrated rigorous TDD process with minimum 80% coverage.
- Added comprehensive docstrings and logging to critical modules.

## Phase 2: Core Feature Development (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Developed initial features with test coverage and clear documentation.
- Established detailed logging strategy (info, warning, error).

## Phase 3: Optimization and Refinement (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Identified performance improvements using logs and testing metrics.
- Refactored for performance and scalability.

## Phase 4: Deployment and Continuous Integration (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Set up automated testing and logging pipelines in CI/CD workflows.

## Phase 4: Maintenance and Future Enhancements (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Logged common issues and implemented enhancements based on developer feedback and analytics.
```

---

## **Phase 5: Logging Strategy and Structure**
- Integrate structured logging at multiple log-levels (`INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`) across the entire codebase, especially:
  - API interactions, data flows, critical business logic
  - Error handling and edge cases
- Log entries must clearly indicate:
  - Timestamp
  - Function/component identifier
  - Input/output states
  - Execution duration (for performance-critical operations)

**Example Logging (Node.js):**
```typescript
import { Logger } from './utils/logger';

function fetchData(url: string): Promise<Data> {
  logger.info(`Fetching data from ${url}`);
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    logger.info(`Fetch succeeded for ${url}`);
    return response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error(`Fetch failed for ${url}`, error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

---

## **Phase 5: Rigorous Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
- Enforce mandatory TDD practices across the codebase.
- Every new feature or bug fix must start with writing failing tests first:

*Sample test (`feature.spec.tsx`):*

```typescript
describe('Auth Component', () => {
  test('renders login form initially', () => {
    render(<AuthComponent />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Log In')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  test('allows user login', async () => {
    render(<AuthComponent />);
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Log In'));
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText('Welcome')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });
});
```

---

## **Phase 6: Time-Saving Design Patterns**
- Automatically identify and employ standard design patterns throughout the codebase, including:
  - **Singleton** for shared instances (logging, config).
  - **Factory Pattern** for object creation.
  - **Strategy Pattern** for interchangeable algorithms.
  - **Observer Pattern** for event-driven architectures.

*Example implementation snippet:*
```typescript
// Singleton Example
class Logger {
  private static instance: Logger;
  private constructor() {}

  static getInstance(): Logger {
    if (!Logger.instance) {
      Logger.instance = new Logger();
    }
    return Logger.instance;
  }

  log(message: string): void {
    console.info(`[INFO]: ${message}`);
  }
}
```

---

## **Phase 6: Final Checks & Sanity Verification**
- Verify all configurations for consistency, clarity, and maintainability.
- Confirm that documentation, logging, testing, and rules are seamlessly integrated into the workflow.
