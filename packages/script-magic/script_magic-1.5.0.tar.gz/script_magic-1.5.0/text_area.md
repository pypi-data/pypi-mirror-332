A widget for editing text which may span multiple lines. Supports text selection, soft wrapping, optional syntax highlighting with tree-sitter and a variety of keybindings.

Guide¶
Code editing vs plain text editing¶
By default, the TextArea widget is a standard multi-line input box with soft-wrapping enabled.

If you're interested in editing code, you may wish to use the TextArea.code_editor convenience constructor. This is a method which, by default, returns a new TextArea with soft-wrapping disabled, line numbers enabled, and the tab key behavior configured to insert \t.

Syntax highlighting dependencies¶
To enable syntax highlighting, you'll need to install the syntax extra dependencies:


pip
poetry

pip install "textual[syntax]"

This will install tree-sitter and tree-sitter-languages. These packages are distributed as binary wheels, so it may limit your applications ability to run in environments where these wheels are not available. After installing, you can set the language reactive attribute on the TextArea to enable highlighting.

Loading text¶
In this example we load some initial text into the TextArea, and set the language to "python" to enable syntax highlighting.

To update the content programmatically, set the text property to a string value.

To update the parser used for syntax highlighting, set the language reactive attribute:


# Set the language to Markdown
text_area.language = "markdown"
Note

More built-in languages will be added in the future. For now, you can add your own.

Reading content from TextArea¶
There are a number of ways to retrieve content from the TextArea:

The TextArea.text property returns all content in the text area as a string.
The TextArea.selected_text property returns the text corresponding to the current selection.
The TextArea.get_text_range method returns the text between two locations.
In all cases, when multiple lines of text are retrieved, the document line separator will be used.

Editing content inside TextArea¶
The content of the TextArea can be updated using the replace method. This method is the programmatic equivalent of selecting some text and then pasting.

Some other convenient methods are available, such as insert, delete, and clear.

Tip

The TextArea.document.end property returns the location at the end of the document, which might be convenient when editing programmatically.

Working with the cursor¶
Moving the cursor¶
The cursor location is available via the cursor_location property, which represents the location of the cursor as a tuple (row_index, column_index). These indices are zero-based and represent the position of the cursor in the content. Writing a new value to cursor_location will immediately update the location of the cursor.


>>> text_area = TextArea()
>>> text_area.cursor_location
(0, 0)
>>> text_area.cursor_location = (0, 4)
>>> text_area.cursor_location
(0, 4)
cursor_location is a simple way to move the cursor programmatically, but it doesn't let us select text.

Selecting text¶
To select text, we can use the selection reactive attribute. Let's select the first two lines of text in a document by adding text_area.selection = Selection(start=(0, 0), end=(2, 0)) to our code:


Output
text_area_selection.py
TextAreaSelection
▊
▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔
▎
▊
1  
def
hello(name):
▎
▊
2  
print
(
"hello"
+
name)
▎
▊
3  
▎
▊
4  
def
goodbye(name):
▎
▊
5  
print
(
"goodbye"
+
name)
▎
▊
6  
▎
▊
▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁
▎


Note that selections can happen in both directions, so Selection((2, 0), (0, 0)) is also valid.

Tip

The end attribute of the selection is always equal to TextArea.cursor_location. In other words, the cursor_location attribute is simply a convenience for accessing text_area.selection.end.

More cursor utilities¶
There are a number of additional utility methods available for interacting with the cursor.

Location information¶
Many properties exist on TextArea which give information about the current cursor location. These properties begin with cursor_at_, and return booleans. For example, cursor_at_start_of_line tells us if the cursor is at a start of line.

We can also check the location the cursor would arrive at if we were to move it. For example, get_cursor_right_location returns the location the cursor would move to if it were to move right. A number of similar methods exist, with names like get_cursor_*_location.

Cursor movement methods¶
The move_cursor method allows you to move the cursor to a new location while selecting text, or move the cursor and scroll to keep it centered.


# Move the cursor from its current location to row index 4,
# column index 8, while selecting all the text between.
text_area.move_cursor((4, 8), select=True)
The move_cursor_relative method offers a very similar interface, but moves the cursor relative to its current location.

Common selections¶
There are some methods available which make common selections easier:

select_line selects a line by index. Bound to F6 by default.
select_all selects all text. Bound to F7 by default.
Themes¶
TextArea ships with some builtin themes, and you can easily add your own.

Themes give you control over the look and feel, including syntax highlighting, the cursor, selection, gutter, and more.

Default theme¶
The default TextArea theme is called css, which takes its values entirely from CSS. This means that the default appearance of the widget fits nicely into a standard Textual application, and looks right on both dark and light mode.

When using the css theme, you can make use of component classes to style elements of the TextArea. For example, the CSS code TextArea .text-area--cursor { background: green; } will make the cursor green.

More complex applications such as code editors may want to use pre-defined themes such as monokai. This involves using a TextAreaTheme object, which we cover in detail below. This allows full customization of the TextArea, including syntax highlighting, at the code level.

Using builtin themes¶
The initial theme of the TextArea is determined by the theme parameter.


# Create a TextArea with the 'dracula' theme.
yield TextArea.code_editor("print(123)", language="python", theme="dracula")
You can check which themes are available using the available_themes property.


>>> text_area = TextArea()
>>> print(text_area.available_themes)
{'css', 'dracula', 'github_light', 'monokai', 'vscode_dark'}
After creating a TextArea, you can change the theme by setting the theme attribute to one of the available themes.


text_area.theme = "vscode_dark"
On setting this attribute the TextArea will immediately refresh to display the updated theme.

Custom themes¶
Note

Custom themes are only relevant for people who are looking to customize syntax highlighting. If you're only editing plain text, and wish to recolor aspects of the TextArea, you should use the provided component classes.

Using custom (non-builtin) themes is a two-step process:

Create an instance of TextAreaTheme.
Register it using TextArea.register_theme.
1. Creating a theme¶
Let's create a simple theme, "my_cool_theme", which colors the cursor blue, and the cursor line yellow. Our theme will also syntax highlight strings as red, and comments as magenta.


from rich.style import Style
from textual.widgets.text_area import TextAreaTheme
# ...
my_theme = TextAreaTheme(
    # This name will be used to refer to the theme...
    name="my_cool_theme",
    # Basic styles such as background, cursor, selection, gutter, etc...
    cursor_style=Style(color="white", bgcolor="blue"),
    cursor_line_style=Style(bgcolor="yellow"),
    # `syntax_styles` is for syntax highlighting.
    # It maps tokens parsed from the document to Rich styles.
    syntax_styles={
        "string": Style(color="red"),
        "comment": Style(color="magenta"),
    }
)
Attributes like cursor_style and cursor_line_style apply general language-agnostic styling to the widget. If you choose not to supply a value for one of these attributes, it will be taken from the CSS component styles.

The syntax_styles attribute of TextAreaTheme is used for syntax highlighting and depends on the language currently in use. For more details, see syntax highlighting.

If you wish to build on an existing theme, you can obtain a reference to it using the TextAreaTheme.get_builtin_theme classmethod:


from textual.widgets.text_area import TextAreaTheme

monokai = TextAreaTheme.get_builtin_theme("monokai")
2. Registering a theme¶
Our theme can now be registered with the TextArea instance.


text_area.register_theme(my_theme)
After registering a theme, it'll appear in the available_themes:


>>> print(text_area.available_themes)
{'dracula', 'github_light', 'monokai', 'vscode_dark', 'my_cool_theme'}
We can now switch to it:


text_area.theme = "my_cool_theme"
This immediately updates the appearance of the TextArea:

TextAreaCustomThemes
▊
▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔
▎
▊
#
 says hello
▎
▊
def hello(name): 
▎
▊
    print(
"hello"
 + name) 
▎
▊
▎
▊
# says goodbye
▄▄
▎
▊
def goodbye(name): 
▎
▊
▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁
▎

Tab and Escape behavior¶
Pressing the Tab key will shift focus to the next widget in your application by default. This matches how other widgets work in Textual.

To have Tab insert a \t character, set the tab_behavior attribute to the string value "indent". While in this mode, you can shift focus by pressing the Esc key.

Indentation¶
The character(s) inserted when you press tab is controlled by setting the indent_type attribute to either tabs or spaces.

If indent_type == "spaces", pressing Tab will insert up to indent_width spaces in order to align with the next tab stop.

Undo and redo¶
TextArea offers undo and redo methods. By default, undo is bound to Ctrl+Z and redo to Ctrl+Y.

The TextArea uses a heuristic to place checkpoints after certain types of edit. When you call undo, all of the edits between now and the most recent checkpoint are reverted. You can manually add a checkpoint by calling the TextArea.history.checkpoint() instance method.

The undo and redo history uses a stack-based system, where a single item on the stack represents a single checkpoint. In memory-constrained environments, you may wish to reduce the maximum number of checkpoints that can exist. You can do this by passing the max_checkpoints argument to the TextArea constructor.

Read-only mode¶
TextArea.read_only is a boolean reactive attribute which, if True, will prevent users from modifying content in the TextArea.

While read_only=True, you can still modify the content programmatically.

While this mode is active, the TextArea receives the -read-only CSS class, which you can use to supply custom styles for read-only mode.

Line separators¶
When content is loaded into TextArea, the content is scanned from beginning to end and the first occurrence of a line separator is recorded.

This separator will then be used when content is later read from the TextArea via the text property. The TextArea widget does not support exporting text which contains mixed line endings.

Similarly, newline characters pasted into the TextArea will be converted.

You can check the line separator of the current document by inspecting TextArea.document.newline:


>>> text_area = TextArea()
>>> text_area.document.newline
'\n'
Line numbers¶
The gutter (column on the left containing line numbers) can be toggled by setting the show_line_numbers attribute to True or False.

Setting this attribute will immediately repaint the TextArea to reflect the new value.

You can also change the start line number (the topmost line number in the gutter) by setting the line_number_start reactive attribute.

Extending TextArea¶
Sometimes, you may wish to subclass TextArea to add some extra functionality. In this section, we'll briefly explore how we can extend the widget to achieve common goals.

Hooking into key presses¶
You may wish to hook into certain key presses to inject some functionality. This can be done by over-riding _on_key and adding the required functionality.

Example - closing parentheses automatically¶
Let's extend TextArea to add a feature which automatically closes parentheses and moves the cursor to a sensible location.


from textual import events
from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.widgets import TextArea


class ExtendedTextArea(TextArea):
    """A subclass of TextArea with parenthesis-closing functionality."""

    def _on_key(self, event: events.Key) -> None:
        if event.character == "(":
            self.insert("()")
            self.move_cursor_relative(columns=-1)
            event.prevent_default()


class TextAreaKeyPressHook(App):
    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield ExtendedTextArea.code_editor(language="python")


app = TextAreaKeyPressHook()
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
This intercepts the key handler when "(" is pressed, and inserts "()" instead. It then moves the cursor so that it lands between the open and closing parentheses.

Typing "def hello(" into the TextArea now results in the bracket automatically being closed:

TextAreaKeyPressHook
▊
▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔
▎
▊

def
hello
(
)
▎
▊
▎
▊
▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁
▎

Advanced concepts¶
Syntax highlighting¶
Syntax highlighting inside the TextArea is powered by a library called tree-sitter.

Each time you update the document in a TextArea, an internal syntax tree is updated. This tree is frequently queried to find location ranges relevant to syntax highlighting. We give these ranges names, and ultimately map them to Rich styles inside TextAreaTheme.syntax_styles.

To illustrate how this works, lets look at how the "Monokai" TextAreaTheme highlights Markdown files.

When the language attribute is set to "markdown", a highlight query similar to the one below is used (trimmed for brevity).


(heading_content) @heading
(link) @link
This highlight query maps heading_content nodes returned by the Markdown parser to the name @heading, and link nodes to the name @link.

Inside our TextAreaTheme.syntax_styles dict, we can map the name @heading to a Rich style. Here's a snippet from the "Monokai" theme which does just that:


TextAreaTheme(
    name="monokai",
    base_style=Style(color="#f8f8f2", bgcolor="#272822"),
    gutter_style=Style(color="#90908a", bgcolor="#272822"),
    # ...
    syntax_styles={
        # Colorise @heading and make them bold
        "heading": Style(color="#F92672", bold=True),
        # Colorise and underline @link
        "link": Style(color="#66D9EF", underline=True),
        # ...
    },
)
To understand which names can be mapped inside syntax_styles, we recommend looking at the existing themes and highlighting queries (.scm files) in the Textual repository.

Tip

You may also wish to take a look at the contents of TextArea._highlights on an active TextArea instance to see which highlights have been generated for the open document.

Adding support for custom languages¶
To add support for a language to a TextArea, use the register_language method.

To register a language, we require two things:

A tree-sitter Language object which contains the grammar for the language.
A highlight query which is used for syntax highlighting.
Example - adding Java support¶
The easiest way to obtain a Language object is using the py-tree-sitter-languages package. Here's how we can use this package to obtain a reference to a Language object representing Java:


from tree_sitter_languages import get_language
java_language = get_language("java")
The exact version of the parser used when you call get_language can be checked via the repos.txt file in the version of py-tree-sitter-languages you're using. This file contains links to the GitHub repos and commit hashes of the tree-sitter parsers. In these repos you can often find pre-made highlight queries at queries/highlights.scm, and a file showing all the available node types which can be used in highlight queries at src/node-types.json.

Since we're adding support for Java, lets grab the Java highlight query from the repo by following these steps:

Open repos.txt file from the py-tree-sitter-languages repo.
Find the link corresponding to tree-sitter-java and go to the repo on GitHub (you may also need to go to the specific commit referenced in repos.txt).
Go to queries/highlights.scm to see the example highlight query for Java.
Be sure to check the license in the repo to ensure it can be freely copied.

Warning

It's important to use a highlight query which is compatible with the parser in use, so pay attention to the commit hash when visiting the repo via repos.txt.

We now have our Language and our highlight query, so we can register Java as a language.


from pathlib import Path

from tree_sitter_languages import get_language

from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.widgets import TextArea

java_language = get_language("java")
java_highlight_query = (Path(__file__).parent / "java_highlights.scm").read_text()
java_code = """\
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
"""


class TextAreaCustomLanguage(App):
    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        text_area = TextArea.code_editor(text=java_code)
        text_area.cursor_blink = False

        # Register the Java language and highlight query
        text_area.register_language("java", java_language, java_highlight_query)

        # Switch to Java
        text_area.language = "java"
        yield text_area


app = TextAreaCustomLanguage()
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
Running our app, we can see that the Java code is highlighted. We can freely edit the text, and the syntax highlighting will update immediately.

Recall that we map names (like @heading) from the tree-sitter highlight query to Rich style objects inside the TextAreaTheme.syntax_styles dictionary. If you notice some highlights are missing after registering a language, the issue may be:

The current TextAreaTheme doesn't contain a mapping for the name in the highlight query. Adding a new key-value pair to syntax_styles should resolve the issue.
The highlight query doesn't assign a name to the pattern you expect to be highlighted. In this case you'll need to update the highlight query to assign to the name.
Tip

The names assigned in tree-sitter highlight queries are often reused across multiple languages. For example, @string is used in many languages to highlight strings.

Navigation and wrapping information¶
If you're building functionality on top of TextArea, it may be useful to inspect the navigator and wrapped_document attributes.

navigator is a DocumentNavigator instance which can give us general information about the cursor's location within a document, as well as where the cursor will move to when certain actions are performed.
wrapped_document is a WrappedDocument instance which can be used to convert document locations to visual locations, taking wrapping into account. It also offers a variety of other convenience methods and properties.
A detailed view of these classes is out of scope, but do note that a lot of the functionality of TextArea exists within them, so inspecting them could be worthwhile.

Registering a language only registers it to this instance of TextArea.

Parameters:

Name	Type	Description	Default
name ¶	str	The name of the language.	required
language ¶	'Language'	A tree-sitter Language object.	required
highlight_query ¶	str	The highlight query to use for syntax highlighting this language.	required
 register_theme ¶

register_theme(theme)
Register a theme for use by the TextArea.

After registering a theme, you can set themes by assigning the theme name to the TextArea.theme reactive attribute. For example text_area.theme = "my_custom_theme" where "my_custom_theme" is the name of the theme you registered.

If you supply a theme with a name that already exists that theme will be overwritten.

 DocumentNavigator ¶

DocumentNavigator(wrapped_document)
Cursor navigation in the TextArea is "wrapping-aware".

Although the cursor location (the selection) is represented as a location in the raw document, when you actually move the cursor, it must take wrapping into account (otherwise things start to look really confusing to the user where wrapping is involved).

Your cursor visually moves through the wrapped version of the document, rather than the raw document. So, for example, pressing down on the keyboard may move your cursor to a position further along the current raw document line, rather than on to the next line in the raw document.

The DocumentNavigator class manages that behavior.

Given a cursor location in the unwrapped document, and a cursor movement action, this class can inform us of the destination the cursor will move to considering the current wrapping width and document content. It can also translate between document-space (a location/(row,col) in the raw document), and visual-space (x and y offsets) as the user will see them on screen after the document has been wrapped.

For this to work correctly, the wrapped_document and document must be synchronised. This means that if you make an edit to the document, you must then update the wrapped document, and then you may query the document navigator.

Naming conventions:

A "location" refers to a location, in document-space (in the raw document). It is entirely unrelated to visually positioning. A location in a document can appear in any visual position, as it is influenced by scrolling, wrapping, gutter settings, and the cell width of characters to its left.

A "wrapped section" refers to a portion of the line accounting for wrapping. For example the line "ABCDEF" when wrapped at width 3 will result in 2 sections: "ABC" and "DEF". In this case, we call "ABC" is the first section/wrapped section.

A "wrap offset" is an integer representing the index at which wrapping occurs in a document-space line. This is a codepoint index, rather than a visual offset. In "ABCDEF" with wrapping at width 3, there is a single wrap offset of 3.

"Smart home" refers to a modification of the "home" key behavior. If smart home is enabled, the first non-whitespace character is considered to be the home location. If the cursor is currently at this position, then the normal home behavior applies. This is designed to make cursor movement more useful to end users.

Parameters:

Name	Type	Description	Default
wrapped_document ¶	WrappedDocument	The WrappedDocument to be used when making navigation decisions.	required
 last_x_offset instance-attribute¶

last_x_offset = 0

 record ¶

record(edit)
Record an Edit so that it may be undone and redone.

Determines whether to batch the Edit with previous Edits, or create a new batch/checkpoint.

This method must be called exactly once per edit, in chronological order.

A new batch/checkpoint is created when:

The undo stack is empty.
The checkpoint timer expires.
The maximum number of characters permitted in a checkpoint is reached.
A redo is performed (we should not add new edits to a batch that has been redone).
The programmer has requested a new batch via a call to force_new_batch.
e.g. the TextArea widget may call this method in some circumstances.
Clicking to move the cursor elsewhere in the document should create a new batch.
Movement of the cursor via a keyboard action that is NOT an edit.
Blurring the TextArea creates a new checkpoint.
The current edit involves a deletion/replacement and the previous edit did not.
The current edit is a pure insertion and the previous edit was not.
The edit involves insertion or deletion of one or more newline characters.
An edit which inserts more than a single character (a paste) gets an isolated batch.
Parameters:

Name	Type	Description	Default
edit ¶	Edit	The edit to record.	required
 EditResult dataclass¶

EditResult(end_location, replaced_text)

 Selection ¶
Bases: NamedTuple

A range of characters within a document from a start point to the end point. The location of the cursor is always considered to be the end point of the selection. The selection is inclusive of the minimum point and exclusive of the maximum point.

 end class-attributeinstance-attribute¶

Create a Selection with the same start and end point - a "cursor".

Parameters:

Name	Type	Description	Default
location ¶	Location	The location to create the zero-width Selection.	required
 SyntaxAwareDocument ¶

SyntaxAwareDocument(text, language)
Bases: Document

A wrapper around a Document which also maintains a tree-sitter syntax tree when the document is edited.

The primary reason for this split is actually to keep tree-sitter stuff separate, since it isn't supported in Python 3.7. By having the tree-sitter code isolated in this subclass, it makes it easier to conditionally import. However, it does come with other design flaws (e.g. Document is required to have methods which only really make sense on SyntaxAwareDocument).

If you're reading this and Python 3.7 is no longer supported by Textual, consider merging this subclass into the Document superclass.

Parameters:

Name	Type	Description	Default
text ¶	str	The initial text contained in the document.	required
language ¶	str | Language	The language to use. You can pass a string to use a supported language, or pass in your own tree-sitter Language object.	required
 language instance-attribute¶

language = get_language(language)
The tree-sitter Language or None if tree-sitter is unavailable.

 get_line ¶

get_line(index)
Return the string representing the line, not including new line characters.

Parameters:

Name	Type	Description	Default
line_index ¶		The index of the line.	required
Returns:

Type	Description
str	The string representing the line.
 prepare_query ¶

prepare_query(query)
Prepare a tree-sitter tree query.

Queries should be prepared once, then reused.

To execute a query, call query_syntax_tree.

Parameters:

Name	Type	Description	Default
query ¶	str	The string query to prepare.	required
Returns:

Type	Description
Query | None	The prepared query.
 query_syntax_tree ¶

query_syntax_tree(query, start_point=None, end_point=None)
Query the tree-sitter syntax tree.

The default implementation always returns an empty list.

To support querying in a subclass, this must be implemented.

Parameters:

Name	Type	Description	Default
query ¶	Query	The tree-sitter Query to perform.	required
start_point ¶	tuple[int, int] | None	The (row, column byte) to start the query at.	None

A theme for the TextArea widget.

Allows theming the general widget (gutter, selections, cursor, and so on) and mapping of tree-sitter tokens to Rich styles.

For example, consider the following snippet from the markdown.scm highlight query file. We've assigned the heading_content token type to the name heading.


(heading_content) @heading
Now, we can map this heading name to a Rich style, and it will be styled as such in the TextArea, assuming a parser which returns a heading_content node is used (as will be the case when language="markdown").


TextAreaTheme('my_theme', syntax_styles={'heading': Style(color='cyan', bold=True)})
We can register this theme with our TextArea using the TextArea.register_theme method, and headings in our markdown files will be styled bold cyan.

 apply_css ¶

apply_css(text_area)
Apply CSS rules from a TextArea to be used for fallback styling.

If any attributes in the theme aren't supplied, they'll be filled with the appropriate base CSS (e.g. color, background, etc.) and component CSS (e.g. text-area--cursor) from the supplied TextArea.

Parameters:

Name	Type	Description	Default
text_area ¶	TextArea	The TextArea instance to retrieve fallback styling from.	required
 builtin_themes classmethod¶

builtin_themes()
Get a list of all builtin TextAreaThemes.

Returns:

Type	Description
list[TextAreaTheme]	A list of all builtin TextAreaThemes.
 get_builtin_theme classmethod¶

get_builtin_theme(theme_name)
Get a TextAreaTheme by name.

Given a theme_name, return the corresponding TextAreaTheme object.

Parameters:

Name	Type	Description	Default
theme_name ¶	str	The name of the theme.	required
Returns:

Type	Description
TextAreaTheme | None	The TextAreaTheme corresponding to the name or None if the theme isn't found.
 get_highlight ¶

get_highlight(name)
Return the Rich style corresponding to the name defined in the tree-sitter highlight query for the current theme.

Parameters:

Name	Type	Description	Default
name ¶	str	The name of the highlight.	required
Returns:

Type	Description
Style | None	The Style to use for this highlight, or None if no style.
 ThemeDoesNotExist ¶
Bases: Exception

Raised when the user tries to use a theme which does not exist. This means a theme which is not builtin, or has not been registered.

 WrappedDocument ¶

WrappedDocument(document, width=0, tab_width=4)
A view into a Document which wraps the document at a certain width and can be queried to retrieve lines from the wrapped version of the document.

Allows for incremental updates, ensuring that we only re-wrap ranges of the document that were influenced by edits.

By default, a WrappedDocument is wrapped with width=0 (no wrapping). To wrap the document, use the wrap() method.

Parameters:

Name	Type	Description	Default
document ¶	DocumentBase	The document to wrap.	required
width ¶	int	The width to wrap at.	0
tab_width ¶	int	The maximum width to consider for tab characters.	4
 document instance-attribute¶

document = document
The document wrapping is performed on.

 height property¶

height
The height of the wrapped document.

 lines property¶

lines
The lines of the wrapped version of the Document.

Each index in the returned list represents a line index in the raw document. The list[str] at each index is the content of the raw document line split into multiple lines via wrapping.

Note that this is expensive to compute and is not cached.

Returns:

Type	Description
list[list[str]]	A list of lines from the wrapped version of the document.
 wrapped property¶

wrapped
True if the content is wrapped. This is not the same as wrapping being "enabled". For example, an empty document can have wrapping enabled, but no wrapping has actually occurred.

In other words, this is True if the length of any line in the document is greater than the available width.

 get_offsets ¶

get_offsets(line_index)
Given a line index, get the offsets within that line where wrapping should occur for the current document.

Parameters:

Name	Type	Description	Default
line_index ¶	int	The index of the line within the document.	required
Raises:

Type	Description
ValueError	When line_index is out of bounds.
Returns:

Type	Description
list[int]	The offsets within the line where wrapping should occur.
 get_sections ¶

get_sections(line_index)
Return the sections for the given line index.

When wrapping is enabled, a single line in the document can visually span multiple lines. The list returned represents that visually (each string in the list represents a single section (y-offset) after wrapping happens).

Parameters:

Name	Type	Description	Default
line_index ¶	int	The index of the line to get sections for.	required
Returns:

Type	Description
list[str]	The wrapped line as a list of strings.
 get_tab_widths ¶

get_tab_widths(line_index)
Return a list of the tab widths for the given line index.

Parameters:

Name	Type	Description	Default
line_index ¶	int	The index of the line in the document.	required
Returns:

Type	Description
list[int]	An ordered list of the expanded width of the tabs in the line.
 get_target_document_column ¶

get_target_document_column(line_index, x_offset, y_offset)
Given a line index and the offsets within the wrapped version of that line, return the corresponding column index in the raw document.

Parameters:

Name	Type	Description	Default
line_index ¶	int	The index of the line in the document.	required
x_offset ¶	int	The x-offset within the wrapped line.	required
y_offset ¶	int	The y-offset within the wrapped line (supports negative indexing).	required
Returns:

Type	Description
int	The column index corresponding to the line index and y offset.
 location_to_offset ¶

location_to_offset(location)
