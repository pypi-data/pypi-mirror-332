# SnowPylot

A Python library for working with CAAML snow profile data from SnowPilot.org.

## Installation

```bash
pip install snowpylot
```

## Usage

```python
from snowpylot import caaml_parser

# Parse a CAAML file
snowpit = caaml_parser("path/to/snowpit.caaml.xml")

# Access snow pit data
print(f"Pit ID: {snowpit.coreInfo.pitID}")
print(f"Date: {snowpit.coreInfo.date}")
print(f"Location: {snowpit.coreInfo.location}")

# Work with layers
for layer in snowpit.snowProfile.layers:
    print(f"Layer at depth {layer.depthTop}")
    print(f"Grain form: {layer.grainFormPrimary.grainForm}")

# Access stability tests
for test in snowpit.stabilityTests.ECT:
    print(f"ECT at depth {test.depthTop}: {test.testScore}")
```

## Features

- Parse CAAML snow profile data from SnowPilot.org
- Access core information (pit ID, date, location, etc.)
- Work with snow layers and grain types
- Access stability test results
- Handle whumpf observations

## Development

To set up the development environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snowpylot.git
cd snowpylot
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Run tests:
```bash
pytest
```

 The data for this project comes from Snowpilot.org


 ## Setting up Jupyter Notebook

 1. Install Jupyter Notebook
    
    ```
    python3 -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install jupyter

    ```

2. Install necessary libraries

   ```
   choco install python
   pip install pandas
   pip install numpy
   pip install matplotlib
   pip install seaborn
   pip install scikit-learn
   ```

Project Objectives:

1. Create a data model and GitHub repository for working with CAAML files from the SnowPilot database (SnowPylot?)
2. Use Jupyter Notebooks to analyze the data and answer research questions
3. Summarize and present results at the Western Snow Conference in May 2025



To do
*Testing*
1. Add tests to check if updating library (Explore Pytest)
2. Add tests to make sure parsing matches caaml file
3. Test process
   Load file
   parse file
   check if parsing matches expected output
4. Set up smaller tests
   ex. "test get_longitude"

*Structure*
1. Make snowPilotObs class a shell
2. Make separate caaml-parser class
* Input: caaml file, version. return: snowpit object

*Create Package*
