    """2-dimensional line integral convolution.

    Apply Line Integral Convolution to a texture array, against a 2D flow (u, v)
    and via a 1D kernel.

    Arguments
    ---------
    texture: 2D numpy array (positional-only)
      Think of this as a tracer fluid. Random noise is a good input in the
      general case.

    u, v: 2D numpy arrays
      Represent the horizontal and vertical components of a vector field,
      respectively.

    kernel: 1D numpy array
      This is the convolution kernel. Think of it as relative weights along a
      portion of a field line. The first half of the array represent weights on
      the "past" part of a field line (with respect to a starting point), while
      the second line represents weights on the "future" part.

    uv_mode: 'velocity' (default), or 'polarization', keyword-only
      By default, the vector (u, v) field is assumed to be velocity-like, i.e.,
      its direction matters. With uv_mode='polarization', direction is
      effectively ignored.

    iterations: (positive) int (default: 1)
      Perform multiple iterations in a loop where the output array texture is
      fed back as the input to the next iteration. Looping is done at the
      native-code level.

    Returns
    -------
    2D numpy array
      The convolved texture. The dtype of the output array is the same as the
      input arrays.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
      If input arrays' dtypes are mismatched.
    ValueError:
      If non-sensical or unknown values are received.

    Notes
    -----
    All input arrays must have the same dtype, which can be either float32 or
    float64.

    Maximum performance is expected for C order arrays.

    With a kernel.size < 5, uv_mode='polarization' is effectively equivalent to
    uv_mode='velocity'. However, this is still a valid use case, so, no warning
    is emitted.

    It is recommended (but not required) to use odd-sized kernels, so that
    forward and backward passes are balanced.

    Kernels cannot contain non-finite (infinite or NaN) values. Although
    unusual, negative values are allowed.

    No effort is made to avoid progpagation of NaNs from the input texture.
    However, streamlines will be terminated whenever a pixel where either u or v
    contains a NaN.

    Infinite values in any input array are not special cased.
