# tur≈üu

This project allows you to write **Gherkin**-based behavior-driven development (BDD) tests
and execute them using **pytest**.

It compiles Gherkin syntax into Python code using **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** manipulation,
enabling seamless integration with pytest for running your tests.


## Features

- Write tests using **Gherkin syntax** (Given, When, Then).
- Compile Gherkin scenarios to Python code using **AST**.
- Execute tests directly with **pytest**.
- Supports **step definitions** in Python for easy test scenario implementation.
- Allows integration with existing pytest setups.

## Installation

```
pip install tursu
