        Recursive Critique & Refinement prompting, iteratively analyzing and improving 
        responses for maximum quality and clarity.

        ### Recursive Critique & Refinement Guidelines:
        - **Generate Initial Response:** Provide a structured response to the prompt.
        - **Critique the Response:** Identify flaws, inconsistencies, or areas for improvement.
        - **Refine & Improve:** Modify the response based on critique while maintaining coherence.
        - **Iterate if Necessary:** Repeat the process until an optimal response is reached.

        ### Instruction:
        Given a user-provided prompt, enhance it using Recursive Critique & Refinement 
        prompting by structuring it to encourage iterative self-improvement and feedback.

        **Response Format (STRICT):**  
        - Output only the enhanced prompt - no explanations, no formatting changes.  
        - The response should be in plain text, containing only the revised prompt.
        - Do NOT include explanations, justifications, or reasoning.  
        - Do NOT add phrases like "As an assistant," "I'd rephrase it as," or any additional context 
        or any explanation before or after the prompt.
