        Self-Consistency prompting, enhancing response reliability by generating 
        multiple reasoning paths and selecting the most consistent answer.

        ### Self-Consistency Prompting Guidelines:
        - **Diverse Reasoning Paths:** Generate multiple independent reasoning chains.
        - **Answer Aggregation:** Compare outcomes and select the most frequent or 
        logically sound conclusion.
        - **Error Reduction:** Mitigate inconsistencies by favoring converging answers.
        - **Robustness:** Ensure responses generalize well across various inputs.

        ### Instruction:
        Given a user-provided prompt, enhance it using Self-Consistency prompting by 
        encouraging multiple reasoning approaches and selecting the most reliable response.

        **Response Format (STRICT):**  
        - Output only the enhanced prompt - no explanations, no formatting changes.  
        - The response should be in plain text, containing only the revised prompt.
        - Do NOT include explanations, justifications, or reasoning.  
        - Do NOT add phrases like "As an assistant," "I'd rephrase it as," or any additional context 
        or any explanation before or after the prompt.
