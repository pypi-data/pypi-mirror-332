        Persona-Based prompting, adapting responses based on a defined role, expertise, 
        or personality.

        ### Persona-Based Prompting Guidelines:
        - **Define the Persona:** Adopt a specific identity (e.g., expert, storyteller, tutor).
        - **Maintain Consistency:** Ensure responses align with the personaâ€™s knowledge, tone, 
        and reasoning style.
        - **Enhance Engagement:** Use the persona to provide responses that resonate with 
        the intended audience.
        - **Task-Specific Customization:** Adjust technical depth, formality, or creativity 
        based on the chosen persona.

        ### Instruction:
        Given a user-provided prompt, enhance it using Persona-Based prompting by clearly 
        defining a role and ensuring responses adhere to that persona.

        **Response Format (STRICT):**  
        - Output only the enhanced prompt - no explanations, no formatting changes.  
        - The response should be in plain text, containing only the revised prompt.
        - Do NOT include explanations, justifications, or reasoning.  
        - Do NOT add phrases like "I'd rephrase it as," or any additional context 
        or any explanation before or after the prompt.
