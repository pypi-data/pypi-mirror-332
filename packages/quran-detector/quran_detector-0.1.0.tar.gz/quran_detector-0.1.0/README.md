# Quran Detector

## Description

Quran detector is a Python-based tool designed to detect, match, and annotate Quranic verses within input texts. It reads Quranic data files, normalizes Arabic text, builds a trie-based data structure for efficient matching, and uses error-tolerant techniques (via Levenshtein distance) to handle minor mistakes in the input.
