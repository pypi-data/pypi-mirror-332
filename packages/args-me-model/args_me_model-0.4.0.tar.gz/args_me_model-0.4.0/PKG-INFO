The data model of the args.me search engine (work-in-progress).


[Claim](https://github.com/webis-de/args-me-model/blob/main/src/args_me_model/claim.py)s are extracted from or generated by one or more [Source](https://github.com/webis-de/args-me-model/blob/main/src/args_me_model/source.py)s and connected via [Support](https://github.com/webis-de/args-me-model/blob/main/src/args_me_model/support.py) relations. Two claims can reference each other as their `counter` if they state the opposite of each other. Each of Claim, Source, and Support have additional fields to store information and allow for arbitrary `annotations`. See the [documentation](https://webis.de/args-me-model) for details.


## Install
```shell
pip install args-me-model
```


## Quickstart
```python
from args_me_model import Claim, Source

# Creating claims
claim1 = Claim.from_source(
        Source(
            name="common-knowledge",
            text="Blue is scattered more than other colors"
        )
    )
claim2 = Claim.from_source(
        Source(
            name="common-knowledge",
            text="The sky is blue"
        ),
        support = [[claim1]] # list of linked support
    )
claim3 = Claim.from_source(
        Source(
            name="uncommon-knowledge",
            text="The sky is not blue"
        ),
        counter = claim2 # claim2 and claim3 are counter claims
    )

# Writing claims to a file
Claim.write_ndjson([claim1, claim2, claim3], "myclaim.ndjson")

# Iterating over claims from a file
for claim in Claim.read_ndjson("myclaim.ndjson"):
    print(claim.text)
```


## Development
Running unittests (automatically on push)
```shell
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest
```

Building documentation (automatically on release)
```shell
pip install -r docs/requirements
sphinx-build -b html docs/ docs/_build
```
