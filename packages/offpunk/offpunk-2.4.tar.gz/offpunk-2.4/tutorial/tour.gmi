# Advanced browsing with "tour"

Unlike most browsers you may know, there are no tabs in Offpunk. Instead, Offpunk has the concept of "tour". (shortcut "t").

Technically, the tour is a FIFO list of all the pages you want to visit.

Letâ€™s imagine that you are on a page with multiple links that look interesting.


=> tour1.gmi First link
=> tour2.gmi Second link
=> tour3.gmi Third link

To add link number 1 to your tour, you can simply write "tour 1". Or, shorter, "t 1".

You can also add multiple links: "t 1 2 3". Or add a range: "t 1-3".

Try to add a range with "t 1-3" now.

> t 1-3

It looks like nothing happened but the links were added to your tour. If you use "tour" or "t" without any number, the next link in you tour will be displayed.

Type "t" now.

> t
