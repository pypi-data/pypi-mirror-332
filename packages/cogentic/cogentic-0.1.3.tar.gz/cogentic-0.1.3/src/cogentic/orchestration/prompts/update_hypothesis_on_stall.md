## Hypothesis Update

- We aren't making as much progress as we would like, and so we may need to revise our current plan.
- This is an opportunity to update the state of the current hypothesis based on the results of the tests.

### Root Cause

Consider what has been going wrong. Refer to our issues and the results of the tests that have been run so far. 

### Updating or Completing the Hypothesis

Based on the results thus far, you need to update the state of the current hypothesis. You can either:
- Mark the current hypothesis as complete if the existing test results validate or disprove the hypothesis.
- Mark the current hypothesis as unverifiable if the hypothesis cannot be verified due to the current team composition or team member failures.
- Leave the current hypothesis as unverified and add new tests to continue our work.

### Tips

- We can't interact with the physical world, and you're basically limited to whatever functionality your team members have. Keep this in mind when you are adding new tests.
