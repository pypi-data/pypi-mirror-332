## Progress Ledger

### Progress Questions

To make progress on answering the question, please answer the following questions, including necessary reasoning:

- Is our original question fully answered? Consider the initial question, along with the facts we have gathered.
- Have we completed work on the current test? If not, do we have additional evidence to add to the test results?
- Consider our current progress in general:
  - Are we making forward progress?
  - Are we in a loop where we keep repeating the same request without making progress?
- Are we encountering issues that are preventing us from making progress? If so, please describe them.
- Consider our progress on the current test:
  - Have we discovered any new evidence that is relevant to our current hypothesis (or the original question)? If so, we want to record this in the ledger.
- Finally, what are our next instructions, and who should we assign them to?
