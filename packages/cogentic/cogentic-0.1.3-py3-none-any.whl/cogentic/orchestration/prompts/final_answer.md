{plan}

### Results

Consider the work that we completed. 

- Based on the results, was our team able to answer the question?
  - If not, then unfortunately we cannot come to a definitive answer. Even if we *think* we know the answer, we need to be honest about the fact that our team didn't solve it.

  - If so, respond with that final answer.

#### Failure

- Failure is OK, let the user know that the results are incomplete, and summarize why we weren't able to come to a final answer.

### CRITICALLY IMPORTANT NOTES

- It's very important that you do not try to solve things yourself at the end. 
- If your team hasn't solved the problem, then it should be marked as "incomplete", even if you think you know the answer.
