# HadoopFileSystem is a class defined by Arrow in a Cython file (_hdfs.pyx).

# "abfss://" prefixes and incorrectly modifies URIs with those prefixes. The
# implementation of HadoopFileSystem where this change is required needs to be
# in Cython, so we have a modified copy of Arrow's _hdfs.pyx in bodo/io
