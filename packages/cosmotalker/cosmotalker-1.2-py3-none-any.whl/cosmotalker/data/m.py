    "miranda":'''Miranda, one of Uranus’ most fascinating moons, is known for its chaotic and diverse surface, featuring deep canyons, towering cliffs, ridges, and unique oval-shaped features called coronae. It has some of the most extreme geological formations in the solar system, including Verona Rupes, a massive cliff that is estimated to be the tallest known in the solar system, with a drop of up to 20 kilometers (12 miles). Miranda’s patchwork appearance suggests a history of intense geological activity, possibly driven by tidal forces from Uranus in the past. The moon is composed mainly of water ice with some rocky material, and its heavily deformed surface indicates past tectonic and possibly cryovolcanic activity. Most of what we know about Miranda comes from Voyager 2’s 1986 flyby, and future missions could provide more insight into its mysterious and rugged landscape.''',
    "mimas":'''Mimas, one of Saturn’s smallest major moons, is best known for its enormous Herschel Crater, which gives it a striking resemblance to the Death Star from *Star Wars*. This impact crater spans about one-third of Mimas' diameter, and if the impact had been any stronger, the moon might have been shattered. Composed mostly of water ice with a small amount of rock, Mimas has a heavily cratered surface, indicating a long history of impacts. Despite its cold and inactive appearance, recent data from the Cassini spacecraft suggest that Mimas may have a subsurface ocean, making it more intriguing than previously thought. Its small size and low density prevent significant geological activity, but its orbital interactions with Saturn and nearby moons help scientists study tidal forces and their effects on planetary bodies.''',
    "mercury":'''Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the Sun, orbiting at an average distance of '57.9 million km'. It has an extremely thin atmosphere, mainly composed of 'oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium', which offers little protection from solar radiation. With a diameter of '4,880 km', it is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Mercury experiences extreme temperature variations, ranging from '430°C' during the day to '-180°C' at night due to its lack of a significant atmosphere. It has a heavily cratered surface, resembling the Moon, and completes one orbit around the Sun in '88 Earth days', while one full rotation on its axis takes '59 Earth days'. Being the fastest planet in the solar system, it moves at an average speed of '47.87 km/s'. Mercury has no moons and is known for its elliptical orbit and the phenomenon of 'perihelion precession', which was explained by Einstein's theory of relativity.''',
    "mars":'''Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is often called the 'Red Planet' due to its reddish appearance caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface. It has a diameter of '6,779 km', making it about half the size of Earth. Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mainly of '95% carbon dioxide, 3% nitrogen, and traces of oxygen and argon', resulting in cold temperatures that can drop as low as '-125°C'. The planet experiences massive dust storms, the largest volcano in the solar system, 'Olympus Mons', and a canyon system, 'Valles Marineris', that dwarfs Earth's Grand Canyon. A Martian day, or 'sol', is about '24.6 hours', and it takes '687 Earth days' to complete one orbit around the Sun. Mars has two small, irregularly shaped moons, 'Phobos' and 'Deimos', which are believed to be captured asteroids. Scientists believe Mars once had liquid water, and ongoing missions are searching for signs of past or present microbial life.''',
    "makemake":'''Makemake is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt and the second-brightest trans-Neptunian object after Pluto. It has a diameter of approximately '1,430 km' and takes about '305 Earth years' to complete one orbit around the Sun. Makemake’s surface is covered with 'methane, ethane, and nitrogen ice', giving it a reddish-brown appearance. It lacks a significant atmosphere, although traces of gases may exist temporarily. A day on Makemake lasts about '22.5 hours'. It has 'one known moon', 'MK2', which was discovered in '2016'. Makemake played a crucial role in the reclassification of Pluto as a dwarf planet and remains an important object for understanding the distant reaches of the solar system.''',
    "moon":'''A unique fact about **our Moon** is that its name is simply 'Moon', unlike the moons of other planets, which have distinct names like 'Europa', 'Titan', or 'Ganymede'. This is because Earth's Moon was the first known natural satellite, and before the discovery of other moons, there was no need to give it a specific name.  

The 'Moon' is Earth's only natural satellite and the fifth largest moon in the solar system, with a diameter of about '3,474 km'. It orbits Earth at an average distance of '384,400 km' and takes approximately '27.3 days' to complete one revolution. The same side of the Moon always faces Earth due to 'synchronous rotation'. Its surface is covered with craters, mountains, and vast plains of solidified lava called 'maria'. The Moon has no atmosphere, causing extreme temperature variations between '127°C' in sunlight and '-173°C' in darkness. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing Earth's axial tilt and controlling ocean tides. Scientists believe the Moon was formed around '4.5 billion years ago' from debris left after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body named 'Theia'.'''
