    'nasa':'''NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is the United States government agency responsible for space exploration, scientific discovery, and aeronautics research. Established in 1958, NASA has led numerous groundbreaking missions, including the Apollo moon landings, the Mars rover explorations, and the development of the International Space Station. The agency continues to push the boundaries of space technology, with ongoing projects like the Artemis program, aiming to return humans to the Moon, and future plans for Mars exploration. Through its research, NASA also contributes to advancements in Earth sciences, satellite technology, and aerospace engineering.''',
    'neowise':''''NEOWISE' is a long-period comet officially designated as **C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE)**, discovered on **March 27, 2020**, by NASA’s **Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE)** space telescope. It became one of the brightest comets visible to the naked eye in the **21st century**, making a spectacular appearance in July 2020.  

The comet's nucleus is estimated to be about **5 kilometers in diameter**, and as it approached the Sun, it developed a **bright dust tail** and a **fainter bluish ion tail**. NEOWISE reached its **closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) on July 3, 2020**, at a distance of **0.29 AU (43.4 million km)**, causing its ice and dust to sublimate and form a glowing coma and tail. On **July 23, 2020**, it made its closest approach to Earth at a distance of **103 million km** before heading back to the outer solar system.  

Observations suggest that 'NEOWISE' is a dynamically new comet, meaning it may not have visited the inner solar system before. It is now traveling on a trajectory that will take it far beyond Pluto, and it is not expected to return for another **6,800 years**. Its appearance provided valuable data on cometary composition, activity, and interactions with solar radiation, making it one of the most significant comets studied in recent years.''',
    'nix':''''Nix' is one of Pluto’s small moons, discovered in 2005 by the Hubble Space Telescope along with 'Hydra'. It has an irregular shape and an estimated diameter of about 49 kilometers. 'Nix' orbits Pluto at an average distance of approximately 48,700 kilometers and takes around 24.9 days to complete one revolution.  

The surface of 'Nix' is composed mainly of water ice, giving it a relatively bright and reflective appearance. Observations from the New Horizons spacecraft in 2015 revealed that 'Nix' has a reddish spot, likely caused by material from Pluto’s surface. One of its most intriguing characteristics is its chaotic rotation, meaning it tumbles unpredictably as it orbits Pluto due to the gravitational influence of Pluto and 'Charon'.  

Scientists believe that 'Nix', along with Pluto’s other small moons, likely formed from debris ejected after a massive impact that created the Pluto-Charon system billions of years ago. Despite its small size, 'Nix' provides valuable insight into the complex gravitational interactions within Pluto’s moon system.''',
    "neso":''''Neso' is the outermost known moon of Neptune, discovered in 2002 using ground-based telescopes. It has an estimated diameter of about 60 kilometers and follows an extremely distant and highly eccentric retrograde orbit, meaning it moves in the opposite direction of Neptune’s rotation. 'Neso' orbits at an average distance of about 48 million kilometers, making it the most distant moon of any planet in the solar system. It takes approximately 26.7 years to complete a single orbit around Neptune.  

Its distant and irregular orbit suggests that 'Neso' was likely a captured Kuiper Belt object rather than forming alongside Neptune. It shares a similar orbit with 'Psamathe', leading scientists to believe that both moons may have originated from a common parent body that was disrupted by a collision. Due to its small size and extreme distance, little is known about its surface composition, but it is believed to be a mix of ice and rock, like other irregular moons of Neptune.''',
    "nereid":''''Nereid' is one of Neptune’s outer moons, discovered in 1949 by astronomer Gerard Kuiper. It is the third-largest moon of Neptune, with an estimated diameter of about 340 kilometers. What makes 'Nereid' particularly interesting is its highly eccentric orbit, which takes it between 1.4 million and 9.7 million kilometers from Neptune. This extreme variation in distance suggests that 'Nereid' may have been a captured object, possibly a former Kuiper Belt body or an early moon of Neptune that was disturbed when Triton was captured.  

Due to its great distance from Neptune and its small size, very little is known about 'Nereid’s' surface or composition. Observations suggest it has a relatively bright surface, possibly covered in water ice, but no spacecraft has ever visited it up close. Its irregular orbit makes it one of the most dynamic and mysterious moons in the solar system, raising questions about Neptune’s early history and the interactions that shaped its moon system.''',
    "naiad":''''Naiad' is the innermost moon of Neptune, discovered in 1989 by the Voyager 2 spacecraft. It is a small, irregularly shaped celestial body, approximately 66 kilometers in diameter, and orbits Neptune at a very close distance. Completing an orbit in just about seven hours, 'Naiad' follows an unusual trajectory, engaging in a delicate orbital dance with its neighboring moon, 'Thalassa'. This motion, known as a 'resonant dance', helps the two moons avoid collision despite their proximity. Due to its closeness to Neptune and the strong gravitational influences, 'Naiad' is likely a captured or fragmented remnant from the planet’s past. Its surface remains largely unknown, as it has only been observed in limited detail.''',
    "neptune":'''Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, with a diameter of '49,244 km', making it the fourth-largest planet in the solar system. It is classified as an 'ice giant' due to its composition of 'hydrogen, helium, water, ammonia, and methane'. Neptune's deep blue color comes from 'methane' in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light. It has the strongest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of up to '2,100 km/h'. A single day on Neptune lasts about '16 hours', while it takes '165 Earth years' to complete one orbit around the Sun. The planet has a faint ring system and at least '14 known moons', with 'Triton' being the largest and the only major moon in the solar system that orbits in the opposite direction of its planet’s rotation. Neptune is one of the coldest and most dynamic planets, with storms and active weather patterns shaping its atmosphere.'''
