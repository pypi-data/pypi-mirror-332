    'uk-space-agency':'''The UK Space Agency is the United Kingdom's government agency responsible for space exploration, satellite development, and space policy. Established in 2010, the agency focuses on advancing the UK’s space capabilities, supporting commercial space industries, and collaborating on international space missions. While the UK does not have a human spaceflight program, it contributes to global projects such as the European Space Agency (ESA) missions and satellite technologies like the Galileo navigation system. The UK Space Agency is also developing spaceports for commercial satellite launches and aims to expand the country's role in the global space industry.''',
    "umbriel":'''Umbriel, one of Uranus' major moons, is the darkest and most heavily cratered of the planet’s large satellites, suggesting that it has remained geologically inactive for most of its history. Composed of a mix of water ice and rock, its surface appears ancient, covered in impact craters, with little evidence of resurfacing processes. One of its most notable features is Wunda, a mysterious bright ring-shaped crater that stands out against the moon’s otherwise dark terrain. The exact reason for Umbriel’s unusually dark surface remains uncertain, but it may be due to the accumulation of dark material from space or chemical changes in its icy crust. Unlike Titania and Oberon, there is little evidence suggesting internal activity or a subsurface ocean, making Umbriel one of the least geologically dynamic moons of Uranus. Most of our knowledge about Umbriel comes from the Voyager 2 flyby in 1986, and future missions may provide more insights into its composition and origin.''',
    "uranus":'''Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and the third-largest in the solar system, with a diameter of '50,724 km'. It is classified as an 'ice giant' due to its composition of 'water, methane, and ammonia' mixed with hydrogen and helium. Uranus has a unique tilt of '98 degrees', causing it to rotate on its side, leading to extreme seasonal variations. A single day on Uranus lasts about '17.2 hours', while it takes '84 Earth years' to complete one orbit around the Sun. The planet appears blue-green due to 'methane' in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light. Uranus has a faint ring system and at least '27 known moons', with 'Titania' being the largest. It experiences the coldest temperatures in the solar system, reaching as low as '-224°C', making it one of the most mysterious and least explored planets.'''
