    "galatea":''''Galatea' is one of Neptune’s inner moons, discovered by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989. It has an irregular shape and an estimated diameter of about 174 kilometers. Orbiting Neptune at a distance of approximately 62,000 kilometers, 'Galatea' completes one revolution in just over ten hours. It is closely associated with Neptune’s Adams Ring, acting as a shepherd moon that helps maintain the ring’s structure through gravitational interactions. Scientists believe 'Galatea' may have formed from debris left behind after Neptune’s original satellite system was disrupted, possibly by the capture of Triton. Due to its small size and proximity to Neptune, little is known about its surface composition or geological features.''',
    "ganymede":'''Ganymede, the largest moon of Jupiter and the biggest in the entire solar system, is even larger than the planet Mercury. It is the only moon known to have its own magnetic field, which creates auroras near its poles. Ganymede's surface is a mix of bright and dark regions, with older, heavily cratered areas and younger, grooved terrains that hint at past geological activity. Scientists believe that beneath its icy crust, Ganymede harbors a deep underground ocean, potentially holding more water than Earth. Its atmosphere is extremely thin, primarily composed of oxygen, but it is not dense enough to support life as we know it. The European Space Agency’s JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) mission aims to study Ganymede in detail, focusing on its magnetic field, subsurface ocean, and potential for habitability.''',
    "galilean-moons":'''The Galilean moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—are the four largest satellites of Jupiter, discovered by Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei in January 1610. These moons were the first celestial bodies observed to orbit another planet, challenging the geocentric model that placed Earth at the center of the universe. Ganymede, the largest among them, surpasses even Mercury in size. As of March 1st 2025, Jupiter is known to have 92 moons in total, with the Galilean moons remaining the most prominent due to their substantial size and unique characteristics.''',
    "gonggong":'''Gonggong is a **possible dwarf planet** and a large trans-Neptunian object (TNO) located in the **scattered disk region** of the solar system. It has an estimated diameter of about '1,230 km', making it one of the largest unclassified TNOs. Gonggong follows an elongated orbit around the Sun, taking approximately '554 Earth years' to complete one revolution. Its surface is believed to be covered with 'methane and water ice', giving it a reddish appearance. Gonggong has one known moon, 'Xiangliu', which was discovered in 2016. Due to its size, Gonggong is expected to be **spherical in shape**, which means it likely qualifies as a **dwarf planet**, though it has not been officially classified by the IAU.'''
