    'ilrs':'''The **International Lunar Research Station (ILRS)** is a planned lunar base led by **China’s CNSA** and **Russia’s Roscosmos**, aimed at establishing a long-term scientific presence on the Moon. Announced in 2021, the ILRS will be developed in multiple phases, starting with robotic missions in the 2020s and culminating in a fully operational lunar station by the 2030s. The project focuses on scientific research, resource utilization, and deep-space exploration. Several countries and organizations have been invited to collaborate, positioning the ILRS as a key competitor to NASA’s **Artemis Program** in future lunar exploration efforts.''',
    'iss':'''The International Space Station (ISS) is a multinational space laboratory in low Earth orbit, used for scientific research, technology development, and international collaboration. Launched in 1998, the ISS is jointly operated by NASA, Roscosmos, JAXA, ESA, and CSA. It serves as a microgravity research hub for experiments in biology, physics, and space medicine, supporting future deep-space missions. Crewed continuously since 2000, the ISS also plays a key role in testing space technologies and fostering global cooperation in space exploration. Plans for its eventual decommissioning are being discussed, with potential replacement by commercial space stations.''',
    'iranian-space-agency':'''The Iranian Space Agency (ISA) is Iran’s national space organization, responsible for space research, satellite development, and space exploration. Established in 2004, ISA has successfully launched several satellites, including Omid, Rasad, and Noor, demonstrating Iran’s growing space capabilities. The agency focuses on telecommunications, Earth observation, and scientific research while developing indigenous satellite launch vehicles like the Safir and Simorgh rockets. ISA aims to expand its space program with future satellite missions, human spaceflight aspirations, and advancements in space technology, positioning Iran as a key player in regional space exploration.''',
    'isro':'''The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is India's national space agency, responsible for space exploration, satellite development, and scientific research. Established in 1969, ISRO has achieved remarkable milestones, including the Chandrayaan missions to the Moon, the Mangalyaan mission to Mars, and the successful deployment of numerous satellites for communication, navigation, and Earth observation. Known for its cost-effective and innovative approach, ISRO launched the Chandrayaan-3 mission, making India the first country to land near the Moon's south pole. The agency continues to expand its capabilities with future projects like the Gaganyaan human spaceflight mission and deep-space exploration initiatives.''',
    "io":'''Io, the innermost of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter, is the most volcanically active body in the solar system. Its surface is covered with hundreds of active volcanoes, constantly reshaped by lava flows and sulfur deposits, giving it a striking yellow-orange appearance. This extreme volcanic activity is caused by the immense tidal forces exerted by Jupiter’s gravity, along with interactions with Europa and Ganymede, which generate internal friction and heat within Io. The moon has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of sulfur dioxide and lacks significant water, unlike its neighboring moons. Scientists study Io to understand planetary volcanism and its role in shaping celestial bodies.'''
