    'dlr':'''The German Aerospace Center (DLR) is Germany's national research organization for aerospace, space exploration, and energy technology. It conducts cutting-edge research in aeronautics, space science, and robotics while also managing Germany's contributions to the European Space Agency (ESA). DLR has played a key role in missions like the Rosetta comet mission, Mars Express, and Earth observation programs. The agency also focuses on advancements in propulsion systems, satellite technology, and sustainable aviation. With ongoing projects in lunar and planetary exploration, DLR continues to be a leading force in aerospace innovation and scientific research.''',
    "despina":''''Despina' is one of Neptune’s inner moons, discovered by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989. It is an irregularly shaped body with an estimated diameter of about 150 kilometers. Orbiting just 52,600 kilometers from Neptune, 'Despina' completes a revolution around the planet in roughly eight hours. It is located near Neptune’s faint ring system and is thought to play a role in shaping and maintaining the rings through gravitational interactions. Scientists believe 'Despina' may be a remnant of a larger moon that was broken apart due to past collisions. Because of its small size and proximity to Neptune, little is known about its surface features or composition.''',
    "deimos":'''Deimos, the smaller and outermost of Mars’ two moons, is an irregularly shaped, rocky body with a heavily cratered and smooth surface due to a layer of fine dust. Measuring only about 12.4 km (7.7 miles) in diameter, it is one of the smallest known moons in the solar system. Unlike its sibling Phobos, Deimos orbits Mars at a greater distance and takes approximately 30.3 hours to complete one orbit. Its composition suggests it may be a captured asteroid from the outer solar system rather than a moon formed alongside Mars. Due to its weak gravity, any material ejected from its surface during impacts tends to escape into space rather than forming noticeable features. While not as closely studied as Phobos, Deimos remains an interesting object for future missions exploring Mars and its moons.''',
    "dione":'''Dione, one of Saturn’s mid-sized moons, is an icy world with a heavily cratered surface and bright, wispy streaks that were once thought to be ice deposits but are now believed to be fractures in the crust. It has a dense core surrounded by a thick ice layer, and some evidence suggests that a subsurface ocean may exist deep beneath its surface. Though Dione appears geologically inactive today, past tectonic activity may have shaped its surface features. The Cassini spacecraft detected a thin exosphere of oxygen around Dione, making it one of the few moons in the solar system with a detectable atmosphere. While it lacks the dramatic geysers of Enceladus, Dione’s history of geological activity and potential for an internal ocean make it an interesting target for future exploration.'''
