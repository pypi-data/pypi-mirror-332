    'artemis-program':'''The Artemis Program is NASA’s initiative to return humans to the Moon and establish a sustainable presence for future deep-space exploration. Announced in 2017, the program aims to land the first woman and the next man on the lunar surface, with a focus on the Moon's south pole. Artemis uses the **Space Launch System (SLS)** rocket and the **Orion** spacecraft to transport astronauts. The **Gateway** lunar space station and **Starship HLS**, developed by SpaceX, will support long-term missions. Artemis lays the foundation for human exploration of Mars, with Artemis I (uncrewed) launched in 2022 and Artemis II (crewed) planned for future missions.''',
    'australian-space-agency':'''The Australian Space Agency (ASA) is Australia’s national space organization, responsible for developing the country’s space industry, satellite technology, and scientific research. Established in 2018, ASA focuses on Earth observation, robotics, and supporting commercial space ventures. Australia has contributed to global space missions through collaborations with NASA, ESA, and JAXA, including supporting lunar and Mars exploration projects. The agency is also working on satellite launches, spaceport development, and deep-space communication networks.

    "ariel":'''Ariel, one of Uranus’ largest moons, is the brightest and most geologically active of its major satellites, with a surface that shows evidence of past tectonic and possibly cryovolcanic activity. Unlike its darker counterparts, Umbriel and Oberon, Ariel's surface is relatively smooth in many areas, with fewer impact craters, suggesting that geological processes have reshaped it over time. Its terrain features deep valleys, fault lines, and long canyons, likely formed by past tectonic activity as the moon’s interior cooled and expanded. Ariel is composed of a mixture of water ice and rock, and some scientists speculate that a subsurface ocean may exist beneath its crust. The Voyager 2 spacecraft provided the only close-up images of Ariel in 1986, but much remains unknown about this intriguing moon. Future missions could help determine whether it has retained any internal heat and explore the possibility of liquid water beneath its surface, making it a compelling target for further study.'''
