    'conae':'''The National Commission on Space Activities (CONAE) is Argentina’s national space agency, responsible for developing and managing the country’s space programs, satellite technology, and scientific research. Established in 1991, CONAE focuses on Earth observation, environmental monitoring, and disaster management through satellites like SAC-D and SAOCOM. The agency collaborates with international partners, including NASA and ESA, to enhance its space capabilities. CONAE also develops indigenous launch systems, such as the Tronador rocket program, aiming to strengthen Argentina’s presence in the global space industry and advance its technological independence in space exploration.''',
    'cnsa':'''The China National Space Administration (CNSA) is the government agency responsible for China's space exploration, satellite launches, and scientific research in space technology. Established in 1993, CNSA has rapidly advanced in space exploration, achieving significant milestones such as the Chang'e lunar missions, the Tianwen-1 Mars mission, and the Tiangong space station. The agency successfully landed a rover on the far side of the Moon and became the second nation to deploy a rover on Mars. CNSA continues to expand its space capabilities with ambitious plans, including future crewed lunar missions and deep space exploration.''',
    "C/2020 F3":''''NEOWISE' is a long-period comet officially designated as **C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE)**, discovered on **March 27, 2020**, by NASA’s **Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE)** space telescope. It became one of the brightest comets visible to the naked eye in the **21st century**, making a spectacular appearance in July 2020.  

The comet's nucleus is estimated to be about **5 kilometers in diameter**, and as it approached the Sun, it developed a **bright dust tail** and a **fainter bluish ion tail**. NEOWISE reached its **closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) on July 3, 2020**, at a distance of **0.29 AU (43.4 million km)**, causing its ice and dust to sublimate and form a glowing coma and tail. On **July 23, 2020**, it made its closest approach to Earth at a distance of **103 million km** before heading back to the outer solar system.  

Observations suggest that 'NEOWISE' is a dynamically new comet, meaning it may not have visited the inner solar system before. It is now traveling on a trajectory that will take it far beyond Pluto, and it is not expected to return for another **6,800 years**. Its appearance provided valuable data on cometary composition, activity, and interactions with solar radiation, making it one of the most significant comets studied in recent years.''',
    "charon":''''Charon' is the largest moon of Pluto and was discovered in 1978 by astronomer James Christy. With a diameter of about 1,212 kilometers, 'Charon' is roughly half the size of Pluto, making it the largest moon relative to its parent planet in the solar system. Because of this, Pluto and 'Charon' are often referred to as a **binary dwarf planet system**, as they orbit a common center of mass located outside Pluto itself.  

The surface of 'Charon' is primarily composed of water ice, unlike Pluto’s nitrogen and methane-rich surface. One of its most notable features is a large, dark reddish region near its north pole, informally called **Mordor Macula**, believed to be caused by organic compounds that originated from Pluto’s escaping atmosphere. 'Charon' has deep canyons, cliffs, and a vast equatorial fracture system, suggesting a history of geological activity. Scientists believe that 'Charon' once had a subsurface ocean that has since frozen, causing its surface to crack.  

The New Horizons spacecraft, which flew past Pluto and 'Charon' in 2015, provided the first detailed images of this moon, revealing its rugged terrain and unexpected geological complexity. Unlike Pluto, 'Charon' has no significant atmosphere, and its surface appears less affected by recent changes. Its formation is believed to be the result of a massive collision between Pluto and another large Kuiper Belt object billions of years ago, similar to how Earth's Moon may have formed.''',
    "calisto":'''Callisto, the second-largest moon of Jupiter and the third-largest moon in the solar system, is known for its heavily cratered and ancient surface, making it one of the most geologically inactive bodies in the solar system. Unlike its neighboring Galilean moons, Callisto shows no signs of internal activity, such as volcanism or tectonic shifts, suggesting it has remained largely unchanged for billions of years. Beneath its thick icy crust, scientists believe there may be a subsurface ocean, though it is uncertain whether it could support life. Callisto’s distance from Jupiter means it experiences weaker tidal forces compared to Io, Europa, and Ganymede, contributing to its lack of geological activity. With its stable surface and low radiation levels, Callisto has been proposed as a potential base for future human exploration of the Jupiter system.''',
    "ceres":'''Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and the only dwarf planet located in the inner solar system. It has a diameter of about '946 km' and makes up about '25%' of the total mass of the asteroid belt. Ceres takes '4.6 Earth years' to complete one orbit around the Sun and has a rotation period of about '9 hours'. Its surface is composed of 'water ice, rock, and hydrated minerals', and scientists believe it may have a subsurface ocean. Ceres has a thin, transient atmosphere containing 'water vapor', possibly due to ice sublimation. The bright spots in the 'Occator Crater' are thought to be deposits of 'sodium carbonate', indicating past hydrothermal activity. As the first dwarf planet visited by a spacecraft, Ceres remains a key target for studying the early solar system and the potential for water beyond Earth.'''
