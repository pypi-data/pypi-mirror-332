    'kari':'''The Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) is South Korea’s national space agency, responsible for aerospace research, satellite development, and space exploration. Established in 1989, KARI has made significant advancements, including the successful launch of the Naro-1 rocket, the development of the KSLV-II (Nuri) launch vehicle, and the Danuri lunar orbiter. The agency also focuses on satellite technology, Earth observation, and space exploration, with future plans for deep space missions and lunar landings. KARI continues to expand South Korea’s presence in the global space industry through innovation and international collaboration.''',
    "kerberos":''''Kerberos' is one of Pluto’s small moons, discovered in 2011 using the Hubble Space Telescope. It has an irregular shape and an estimated diameter of about 19 kilometers, making it smaller than Pluto’s other moons. 'Kerberos' orbits Pluto at an average distance of approximately 58,000 kilometers and takes around 32 days to complete one revolution.  

Unlike Pluto’s other small moons, 'Kerberos' appears darker and less reflective, suggesting it has a different surface composition or origin. Scientists were initially surprised by this finding because they expected it to be as bright as 'Nix' and 'Hydra', which are covered in water ice. Observations from the New Horizons spacecraft in 2015 showed that 'Kerberos' has a double-lobed shape, possibly formed by the merger of two smaller bodies.  

Like 'Nix', 'Hydra', and 'Styx', 'Kerberos' is believed to have formed from debris created by a massive impact that led to the formation of the Pluto-Charon system. Its unusual appearance and chaotic rotation provide valuable insights into the complex gravitational interactions and history of Pluto’s moons.'''
