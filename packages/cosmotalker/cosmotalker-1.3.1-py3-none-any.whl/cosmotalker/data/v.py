    'virgin-galactic':'''Virgin Galactic is a private space tourism company founded by Richard Branson in 2004, focused on suborbital space travel. It uses the **VSS Unity** spaceplane, launched from a carrier aircraft, to take passengers on brief spaceflights, offering a few minutes of weightlessness and a view of Earth from space. The company successfully launched its first commercial spaceflight in 2023 and continues to expand its space tourism services. Virgin Galactic aims to make space travel more accessible while also exploring potential future applications in high-speed point-to-point travel and research missions.''',
    'vesta':''''Vesta' is one of the largest asteroids in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, with a diameter of about 525 kilometers. It was discovered in 1807 by Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers and is the second-largest body in the asteroid belt after 'Ceres'. 'Vesta' is unique because it is considered a **protoplanet**, meaning it has characteristics of a planet but never fully developed into one.  

Its surface is covered in basaltic rock, indicating that it once had volcanic activity and a molten interior. The most striking feature of 'Vesta' is the **Rheasilvia crater**, a massive impact basin at its south pole, which is nearly 500 kilometers wide and about 19 kilometers deep. This impact is believed to have ejected a significant amount of debris, which led to the formation of Vestoid asteroids and meteorites found on Earth.  

'Vesta' was explored up close by NASA’s Dawn spacecraft in 2011–2012, revealing details about its complex geological history, including mountain ranges, valleys, and evidence of ancient lava flows. Scientists believe that studying 'Vesta' helps in understanding the early solar system since it represents a building block of planetary formation.''',
    "venus":'''Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth's 'twin' due to its similar size, with a diameter of '12,104 km'. However, it has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of 'carbon dioxide' with clouds of 'sulfuric acid', creating a runaway greenhouse effect that makes it the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures reaching '467°C'. Venus has a slow and retrograde rotation, taking '243 Earth days' to complete one full spin, while its orbit around the Sun takes '225 Earth days', making its day longer than its year. The planet's surface is covered with volcanic plains, vast highlands, and thousands of volcanoes, some possibly still active. Venus has no moons and experiences extreme atmospheric pressure, about '92 times' that of Earth. It also exhibits a phenomenon called 'super-rotation', where its thick clouds move much faster than the planet itself, completing a full rotation in just 'four Earth days'.'''
