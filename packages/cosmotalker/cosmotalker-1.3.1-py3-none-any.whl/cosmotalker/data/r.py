    'roscosmos':'''Roscosmos, officially known as the State Corporation for Space Activities Roscosmos, is Russia's governmental agency responsible for space exploration, satellite launches, and scientific research in space technology. Established in 1992 as the successor to the Soviet space program, Roscosmos has played a crucial role in global space exploration. It operates the Soyuz spacecraft, which has been a key transport vehicle for astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). The agency has also contributed to lunar and planetary missions, satellite development, and deep space research. Roscosmos continues to collaborate with international partners while developing future projects, including a planned Russian space station and lunar exploration missions.''',
   "rhea":'''Rhea, the second-largest moon of Saturn after Titan, is an icy world with a heavily cratered surface and faint traces of a thin atmosphere composed mainly of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Its surface is covered with bright, reflective ice, making it one of the most reflective moons in the solar system. Unlike its more active neighbor Enceladus, Rhea shows no signs of internal geological activity, indicating that it has been a geologically dead world for billions of years. Some studies suggest that Rhea might have a tenuous ring system, which, if confirmed, would make it the only known moon with rings. Though not considered a prime candidate for extraterrestrial life, studying Rhea helps scientists understand the formation and evolution of icy moons in the outer solar system.'''
