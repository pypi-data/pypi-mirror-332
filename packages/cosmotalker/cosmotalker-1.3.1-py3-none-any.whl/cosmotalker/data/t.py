    'turkish-space-agency':'''The Turkish Space Agency (TUA) is Turkey’s national space organization, responsible for coordinating the country’s space research, satellite development, and exploration efforts. Established in 2018, TUA focuses on advancing satellite technology, space science, and national security applications. Turkey has successfully launched satellites such as Göktürk and Türksat for Earth observation and communications. The agency has ambitious plans, including a lunar mission, the development of indigenous satellite launch capabilities, and expanding international collaborations. TUA aims to strengthen Turkey’s presence in the global space industry through innovation and technological advancements.''',
    "triton":''''Triton' is the largest moon of Neptune and one of the most unique moons in the solar system. Discovered by British astronomer William Lassell in 1846, it has a diameter of about 2,710 kilometers, making it the seventh-largest moon in the solar system. Unlike most large moons, 'Triton' orbits Neptune in a **retrograde** direction, meaning it moves in the opposite direction of the planet’s rotation. This unusual orbit suggests that 'Triton' was originally a Kuiper Belt object that was later captured by Neptune’s gravity.  

'Triton' has an extremely cold surface, with temperatures dropping as low as -235°C, making it one of the coldest places in the solar system. Despite this, it has a thin atmosphere composed mainly of nitrogen, along with traces of methane. The surface is covered with a mix of frozen nitrogen, water ice, and carbon dioxide, giving it a bright and reflective appearance. One of its most remarkable features is its **cryovolcanism**, where geysers of liquid nitrogen erupt from beneath the surface, driven by solar heating. Scientists believe that beneath its icy crust, 'Triton' may have a subsurface ocean, raising the possibility of liquid water and even microbial life.  

Because of its retrograde orbit, 'Triton' is slowly spiraling toward Neptune and will eventually be torn apart by the planet’s gravity in about 3.6 billion years. Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to have visited 'Triton', capturing stunning images and revealing it as one of the most geologically active moons in the outer solar system.''',
    "thalassa":''''Thalassa' is one of Neptune’s inner moons, discovered in 1989 by the Voyager 2 spacecraft. It is a small, irregularly shaped body with an estimated diameter of about 82 kilometers. Orbiting Neptune at a distance of approximately 50,000 kilometers, 'Thalassa' completes a full revolution in just over seven hours. It shares a unique orbital relationship with 'Naiad', where the two moons engage in a rare ‘resonant dance’, preventing them from colliding despite their close proximity. Scientists believe 'Thalassa' may have formed from debris left after Neptune’s original satellite system was disrupted, possibly by the capture of Triton. Due to its size and distance, little is known about its surface composition or geological features.''',
    "titania":'''Titania, the largest moon of Uranus, is an icy and rocky world with a heavily cratered surface marked by deep faults and canyons, suggesting past geological activity. It is composed of roughly equal parts water ice and rock, and scientists believe that a subsurface ocean may exist beneath its frozen crust. One of Titania’s most notable features is Messina Chasma, a massive canyon system that hints at tectonic processes that may have once shaped the moon. Its thin atmosphere, primarily composed of carbon dioxide, is extremely tenuous and barely detectable. Titania, along with other Uranian moons, remains relatively unexplored, with most of our knowledge coming from the Voyager 2 flyby in 1986. Future missions could provide more insights into its composition, internal structure, and the possibility of an underground ocean.''',
    "tethys":'''Tethys, one of Saturn’s mid-sized moons, is an icy world with a bright, heavily cratered surface, composed mostly of water ice with some traces of rock. One of its most prominent features is the massive Odysseus crater, which spans nearly two-fifths of the moon’s diameter, indicating a past impact that nearly shattered it. Another striking feature is the Ithaca Chasma, a vast canyon system that stretches almost 75% of Tethys’ circumference, possibly formed by the moon’s internal cooling and expansion. Despite its heavily cratered and inactive appearance, Tethys orbits within Saturn’s radiation belt and has a tenuous exosphere composed of oxygen. While it lacks significant geological activity, studying Tethys provides insights into the history of Saturn’s moons and the processes that shaped the icy bodies of the outer solar system.''',
    "titan":'''Titan, the largest moon of Saturn and the second-largest in the solar system after Ganymede, is unique for having a thick atmosphere, primarily composed of nitrogen with traces of methane. Its dense, orange-hued atmosphere obscures the surface, which is shaped by rivers, lakes, and seas of liquid hydrocarbons like methane and ethane, making it the only other known place in the solar system with stable liquid bodies on its surface. Titan's surface temperature is extremely cold, around -179°C (-290°F), preventing water from existing as a liquid, but beneath its icy crust, scientists believe a vast subsurface ocean of liquid water may exist. This combination of organic molecules, energy sources, and liquid environments makes Titan one of the most intriguing candidates for studying prebiotic chemistry and the potential for extraterrestrial life. NASA’s Dragonfly mission, set to launch in the mid-2030s, aims to explore Titan’s surface, investigating its chemistry and habitability in greater detail.'''
