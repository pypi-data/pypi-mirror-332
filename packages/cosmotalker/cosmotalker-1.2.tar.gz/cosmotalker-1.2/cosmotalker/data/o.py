    'oneweb':'''OneWeb is a global communications company focused on building a satellite constellation to provide high-speed internet access worldwide. Founded in 2012, OneWeb aims to bridge the digital divide by offering connectivity to remote and underserved regions. The company has launched hundreds of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, working toward a fully operational global network. OneWeb partners with governments, businesses, and telecommunications providers to expand broadband coverage. Following financial restructuring in 2020, it is now jointly owned by Eutelsat and the UK government, continuing to compete with other satellite internet providers like Starlink.''',
    'oort-cloud':''''Oort Cloud' is a hypothetical, distant region of the solar system believed to be a vast, spherical shell of icy bodies surrounding the Sun. It is thought to extend from about 2,000 AU (astronomical units) to possibly 100,000 AU from the Sun, placing it far beyond the Kuiper Belt and even the heliosphere. The concept of the 'Oort Cloud' was proposed by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1950 to explain the origins of long-period comets, which have highly eccentric orbits and can take thousands or even millions of years to return to the inner solar system.  

The 'Oort Cloud' is believed to contain trillions of icy objects, remnants from the early formation of the solar system. These objects are thought to be loosely bound to the Sun and can be disturbed by passing stars, galactic tides, or other gravitational interactions, occasionally sending comets toward the inner solar system. Unlike the Kuiper Belt, which contains known objects like Pluto and Eris, no direct observations of the 'Oort Cloud' have been made due to its extreme distance and faintness.  

Scientists theorize that the 'Oort Cloud' consists of two regions: an inner, disk-like structure and an outer, more spherical shell. If confirmed, it would represent the outermost boundary of the solar system’s influence. Studying long-period comets that originate from this region may provide valuable insights into the early conditions of the solar system and the processes that shaped its formation.''',
    "oberon":'''Oberon, the second-largest moon of Uranus, is an icy and rocky world covered in impact craters, making it one of the most heavily cratered moons in the solar system. Some of these craters have bright ejecta patterns, indicating relatively recent impacts, while others appear darkened due to space weathering. The presence of large fault-like structures suggests that Oberon may have experienced tectonic activity in the past. Like Titania, Oberon is thought to have a composition of roughly equal parts water ice and rock, and scientists speculate that a subsurface ocean could exist beneath its frozen surface. Its location at the outermost edge of Uranus’ major moons means it has been less affected by the planet’s gravitational interactions. Most of what we know about Oberon comes from Voyager 2’s flyby in 1986, and future missions could reveal more about its geology and potential for an underground ocean.''',
 "orcus":'''Orcus is a **possible dwarf planet** and a large trans-Neptunian object (TNO) in the Kuiper Belt. It has an estimated diameter of about '910 km' and follows an orbit similar to Pluto but in a **near-opposite phase**, making it a **Plutino**, meaning it is locked in a **2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune**. Orcus takes about '247 Earth years' to complete one orbit around the Sun. Its surface is believed to be covered with 'methane, water ice, and possibly ammonia', giving it a moderately reflective appearance. Orcus has one known moon, 'Vanth', which is relatively large compared to its parent body and orbits at a close distance. Some scientists suspect that Orcus, like Pluto, may have a subsurface ocean. While it is not yet officially classified as a dwarf planet, its size, shape, and composition suggest it is highly likely to be one.'''
