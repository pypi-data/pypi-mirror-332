    'planet9':''''Planet Nine' is a **hypothetical** planet in the outer reaches of the Solar System, believed to exist based on unusual gravitational effects observed in the orbits of distant trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). First proposed in '2016' by astronomers 'Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown', this unseen planet is theorized to be much larger than Earth, possibly around '5 to 10 times Earth's mass', and orbiting at a vast distance, estimated to be '400 to 800 AU' from the Sun.  

The evidence for 'Planet Nine' comes from the clustering of orbits among certain Kuiper Belt objects, which appear to be influenced by the gravity of a large, unseen body. Computer simulations suggest that a planet with such mass and orbit could explain these anomalies. However, direct observation has not yet confirmed its existence, leading some astronomers to explore alternative explanations, such as a disk of smaller icy bodies or even a primordial black hole.  

If 'Planet Nine' exists, it would take thousands of years to complete a single orbit around the Sun due to its extreme distance. Future sky surveys, such as those conducted by the 'Vera C. Rubin Observatory', may help confirm or rule out its presence. Until then, 'Planet Nine' remains one of the most intriguing mysteries of modern planetary science.''',

    'pallas':''''Pallas' is one of the largest asteroids in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, with a diameter of about 512 kilometers. It was discovered in 1802 by German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers and is the second asteroid ever found after 'Ceres'. 'Pallas' is unique because it has a highly inclined and eccentric orbit compared to most other asteroids, making it difficult to study.  

Its surface appears dark and heavily cratered, suggesting that it has remained largely unchanged since the early solar system. 'Pallas' is classified as a B-type asteroid, meaning it is rich in carbon and silicates, indicating that it may have formed far from the Sun. Unlike 'Vesta', which shows signs of past volcanic activity, 'Pallas' appears more primitive, preserving its ancient composition.  

Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and other instruments suggest that 'Pallas' may have experienced collisions that shaped its irregular structure. Scientists believe studying 'Pallas' can provide insights into the formation of asteroids and the early solar system, as it represents a remnant of the building blocks that formed planets.''',
    'pluto':''''Pluto' is a dwarf planet located in the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune. It was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh and was originally classified as the ninth planet in the solar system. However, in 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) redefined the criteria for planets, leading to Pluto being reclassified as a dwarf planet.  

With a diameter of about 2,377 kilometers, 'Pluto' is smaller than Earth’s Moon but has a complex and diverse surface. It is composed mainly of rock and ice, with a thin atmosphere made of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide. The surface features mountains of water ice, vast plains of frozen nitrogen, and large canyons, including the famous heart-shaped region known as **Tombaugh Regio**.  

One of the most significant features of 'Pluto' is its largest moon, 'Charon', which is so large relative to Pluto that they form a binary system, orbiting a common center of gravity. Pluto also has four smaller moons: 'Nix', 'Hydra', 'Kerberos', and 'Styx'.  

The New Horizons spacecraft provided the first close-up images of 'Pluto' in 2015, revealing its unexpectedly active geology, including possible cryovolcanism and glacial movement. Scientists believe that 'Pluto' formed about 4.5 billion years ago in the Kuiper Belt and may hold clues about the early solar system. Despite its reclassification, 'Pluto' remains an object of fascination due to its unique characteristics and ongoing scientific discoveries.''',
    "psamathe":''''Psamathe' is one of Neptune’s outermost moons, discovered in 2003 using ground-based telescopes. It has an estimated diameter of about 40 kilometers and follows an extremely distant and highly eccentric retrograde orbit, meaning it moves in the opposite direction of Neptune’s rotation. Orbiting at an average distance of about 46 million kilometers, 'Psamathe' takes nearly 25 years to complete one revolution around Neptune, making it one of the most distant known moons of the planet.  

Its retrograde motion and distant orbit suggest that 'Psamathe' was likely captured from the Kuiper Belt rather than forming alongside Neptune. It shares many orbital similarities with another irregular moon, 'Neso', leading scientists to believe that both may have originated from a common parent body that broke apart. Due to its small size and extreme distance, little is known about its composition, but it is thought to be a mix of ice and rock, like other irregular moons of Neptune.''',
 "proteus":''''Proteus' is the second-largest moon of Neptune, discovered by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989. It has an irregular, somewhat boxy shape with a diameter of approximately 420 kilometers. Orbiting Neptune at a distance of about 117,600 kilometers, 'Proteus' completes one revolution in nearly 27 hours. Unlike many of Neptune’s other moons, which are smooth due to geological activity, 'Proteus' has a heavily cratered surface, indicating that it has remained geologically inactive for billions of years. Scientists believe it may have formed from the same material as Neptune’s original satellite system, which was later disrupted by the capture of Triton. One of its most notable features is Pharos, a large impact crater that suggests a violent past. 'Proteus' is also thought to be the parent body of 'Hippocamp', which may have formed from debris ejected by an ancient collision.''',
    "pluto":'''Pluto is a dwarf planet located in the Kuiper Belt, a region beyond Neptune filled with icy bodies. It has a diameter of '2,377 km', making it smaller than Earth's Moon. Pluto was once considered the ninth planet, but in '2006', it was reclassified as a 'dwarf planet' by the International Astronomical Union due to its inability to clear its orbit of other debris. It has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of 'nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide', which expands and contracts as Pluto orbits the Sun. A day on Pluto lasts about '153 hours', while a full orbit takes '248 Earth years'. Its surface features icy plains, mountains made of water ice, and frozen nitrogen dunes. Pluto has 'five known moons', with 'Charon' being the largest, nearly half the size of Pluto itself. Despite its small size, Pluto remains an object of great scientific interest, offering insights into the early solar system.''',
    "phobos":'''Phobos is the larger and closer of Mars' two natural satellites, with an irregular shape and a diameter of about '22.4 km'. It orbits Mars at an extremely close distance of only '6,000 km', completing a full orbit in just '7 hours and 39 minutes', making it one of the fastest-orbiting moons in the solar system. Due to its proximity to Mars, Phobos is gradually spiraling inward and is expected to either crash into Mars or break apart to form a ring in about '50 million years'. Its surface is covered in craters, with the largest, 'Stickney Crater', spanning nearly half its width. Scientists believe Phobos may be a captured asteroid from the 'main asteroid belt' or a remnant from Mars' early formation.''',
    "deimos":'''Deimos is the smaller and more distant of Mars' two natural satellites, with an irregular shape and a diameter of about '12.4 km'. It orbits Mars at a distance of approximately '23,460 km' and takes around '30.3 hours' to complete one revolution. Unlike its companion, Phobos, Deimos is slowly drifting away from Mars over time. Its surface is covered in a layer of loose dust and small craters, giving it a smoother appearance compared to Phobos. Scientists believe Deimos may be a captured asteroid from the 'main asteroid belt' or a fragment from Mars' early formation. Due to its low gravity, any object kicked up from its surface could escape into space rather than falling back down.'''
