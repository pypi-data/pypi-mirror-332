    'esa':'''The European Space Agency (ESA) is an intergovernmental organization dedicated to space exploration, scientific research, and technological development. Founded in 1975, ESA consists of 22 member states working together on various space missions. The agency has made significant contributions to space science, including the Rosetta mission to a comet, the Mars Express orbiter, and collaboration on the International Space Station (ISS). ESA also develops advanced satellite technology, such as the Galileo navigation system and the Copernicus Earth observation program. With future plans for Moon and Mars exploration, ESA continues to be a key player in global space exploration and innovation.''',
    'encke':''''Encke' is a short-period comet, officially designated as '2P/Encke', with an orbital period of only '3.3 years', making it one of the most frequently returning comets. It was first observed in '1786' by Pierre Méchain, but its periodic nature was recognized by 'Johann Franz Encke' in '1819', who calculated its orbit and predicted its return.  

Unlike most comets, which originate from the 'Oort Cloud' or 'Kuiper Belt', 'Encke' is thought to be a remnant of a much larger comet that gradually fragmented over thousands of years. It has a small nucleus, about '4.8 kilometers in diameter', and orbits closer to the Sun than any other known periodic comet. Due to its frequent visits, 'Encke' loses material at a faster rate, making its coma and tail less prominent than those of longer-period comets.  

'Encke' is also linked to the 'Taurid meteor showers', which occur annually when Earth passes through its debris stream. Some scientists believe that larger fragments from this comet could have been responsible for historical impact events, such as the 'Tunguska event' in '1908'.  

Its short orbital period and stable path have made it an important object of study, helping astronomers understand the long-term evolution of comets and their interaction with the inner solar system.''',
    "enceladus":'''Enceladus, one of Saturn’s most fascinating moons, is a small but active world known for its icy surface and powerful geysers that erupt from its south pole. These geysers shoot water vapor, ice particles, and organic molecules into space, forming Saturn’s E-ring and providing strong evidence of a subsurface ocean beneath the moon’s icy crust. Scientists believe that hydrothermal activity at the ocean’s seafloor could create conditions suitable for microbial life, making Enceladus one of the most promising places in the solar system to search for extraterrestrial life. The Cassini spacecraft, which studied Saturn and its moons, flew through these plumes and detected organic compounds, salts, and even possible energy sources that could sustain life. The discovery of Enceladus' hidden ocean and its dynamic activity has sparked interest in future missions to explore this icy moon further and investigate its potential habitability.''',
    "earth": '''Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to support life. With a diameter of '12,742 km', it has a dense atmosphere composed mainly of '78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other gases', which regulates temperature and protects against harmful solar radiation. About '71%' of Earth's surface is covered by water, making it unique among terrestrial planets. It orbits the Sun in '365.25 days' and rotates on its axis every '24 hours', causing day and night. Earth's magnetic field, generated by its liquid iron core, shields it from solar winds. The planet has a diverse climate, ranging from polar ice caps to tropical rainforests, and a dynamic system of plate tectonics that shapes its surface over time. Earth has one natural satellite, the 'Moon', which influences tides and stabilizes its axial tilt, contributing to a stable climate. ''',
    "eris":'''Eris is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt and one of the most massive known dwarf planets in the solar system, with a diameter of approximately '2,326 km'. It was discovered in '2005' and played a key role in the reclassification of Pluto as a 'dwarf planet' in '2006'. Eris has a highly elliptical orbit that takes about '557 Earth years' to complete one revolution around the Sun. It has an extremely cold surface, primarily composed of 'frozen nitrogen and methane'. A day on Eris lasts around '25.9 hours'. It has one known moon, 'Dysnomia', which helps scientists estimate its mass. Eris is one of the most distant objects in the solar system and remains an important subject of study in understanding the outer solar system and the Kuiper Belt.''',
    "europa":'''Europa, one of Jupiter’s Galilean moons, is a fascinating celestial body known for its smooth, icy surface and the potential for an underground ocean. Scientists believe that beneath its thick ice crust lies a vast, salty ocean that may contain twice as much water as all of Earth's oceans combined. This has made Europa a prime candidate for the search for extraterrestrial life. The moon’s surface is crisscrossed by dark streaks, which are thought to be cracks in the ice caused by tidal forces from Jupiter's gravity. These forces also generate internal heat, preventing the subsurface ocean from freezing completely. Occasional plumes of water vapor detected by spacecraft suggest that some of this water might be escaping into space. With upcoming missions like NASA’s Europa Clipper, scientists hope to gather more data on its potential habitability and the mysteries hidden beneath its icy shell.'''
