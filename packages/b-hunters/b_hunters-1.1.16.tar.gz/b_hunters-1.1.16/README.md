**B-Hunters** is a bug bounty framework built on the [Karton](https://github.com/CERT-Polska/karton) framework. It leverages Docker to execute multiple tools and tasks across different machines, providing a powerful, modular, and scalable approach to reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning.

B-Hunters automates the entire recon process by utilizing multiprocessing and microservices to ensure efficiency, flexibility, and ease of integration.

Results can be integrated with discord webhooks to be sent once tool running finish or using the command line

## Features

- **Automation**: Automates recon and scanning tasks to save time and reduce manual effort.
- **Modularity**: Built on a microservices architecture, allowing easy customization and extension.
- **Scalability**: Handles large-scale tasks with multiprocessing and distributed workloads.
- **Integration**: Feeds the output of one tool seamlessly into another.
- **Dockerized**: Provides containerized environments for consistent and isolated tool execution.

---

## Why B-Hunters?

B-Hunters uses a microservices architecture to provide these features:

- **Isolation**: Each tool runs in its own container, ensuring no interference between tools.
- **Resilience**: Faults in one service do not affect others.
- **Scalability**: Allows horizontal scaling by distributing services across multiple machines.
- **Flexibility**: Enables you to easily replace or update individual components without disrupting the entire framework.
- **Parallelism**: Tasks are processed concurrently, significantly reducing recon time.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/B-Hunters/B-Hunters.git
   cd B-Hunters
   pip install .
   ```
2. **Install Using pip**:
    ```bash
    pip install b-hunters
    ```

## Config

You have first to update **b-hunters.example.ini** file with your **IP** and other configs if you want to edit.
**Remember when you update settings when running tools use the same config file**
Config file by default should be in **/etc/b-hunters/b-hunters.ini"** if you want insomething else use **-c** flag when calling command

# Usage


The tool provides two main commands: `scan` and `report`. These commands allow you to perform scans on domains and generate reports. Below is a detailed explanation of each command and its options.

## General Options

| Option            | Description                                      | Default                               |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `--config`, `-c`  | Optional path to the configuration file.          | `/etc/b-hunters/b-hunters.ini`       |

|


#### Usage:
```bash
b-hunters  [-c <config_path>] scan --domain <target_domain> --scantype <single or multi> [--description <description>]
```
For example to scan all subdomains in example.com

```bash
b-hunters scan -d example.com -t multi
```
### 2. Report Command

Generate a scan report for a specified domain.
#### **Options**

| **Option**            | **Description**                                  | **Required** |

# Future Plan

Here are the planned features and improvements for the tool:

-  **Create Web Interface**
  Develop a user-friendly web interface to manage scans and reports.
