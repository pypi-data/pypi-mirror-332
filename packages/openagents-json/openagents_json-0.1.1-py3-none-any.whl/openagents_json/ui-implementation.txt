## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Complete Interactive Editing Features**:
   - Enhance drag-and-drop editing functionalities, including node/edge editing and a properties panel for detailed configuration.
   - Implement validation overlays directly on the workflow diagram for immediate feedback.

2. **Expand Integration Testing**:
   - Increase coverage for component interactions, ensuring seamless data flow between UI components and the API client.

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Conduct profiling on complex workflows to identify potential bottlenecks in rendering, and leverage React Flow's optimization strategies.

4. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Implement robust keyboard navigation, integrate proper ARIA attributes, and ensure color contrast compliance.

5. **Documentation Enhancements**:
   - Update user guides and developer documentation to reflect new features and best practices.
   - Develop tutorials and sample workflows to aid new users.

6. **E2E Testing Implementation**:
   - Begin end-to-end tests using Cypress or Playwright to simulate critical user flows from workflow creation to validation and editing.
