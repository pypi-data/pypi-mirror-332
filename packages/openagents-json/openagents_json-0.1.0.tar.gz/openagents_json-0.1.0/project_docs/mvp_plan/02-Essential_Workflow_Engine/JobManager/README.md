# JobManager Component

## Overview
The JobManager is a critical component of the OpenAgents JSON workflow engine that handles the creation, execution, and lifecycle management of workflow jobs. It provides a robust API for controlling workflow execution instances with features such as prioritization, cancellation, and state management.

## Issue Reference
This implementation is being developed as part of [Issue #31: Create JobManager Class](https://github.com/nznking/openagents-json/issues/31).

## Documentation Structure

### Implementation Plan
[JobManager_Implementation_Plan.md](./JobManager_Implementation_Plan.md) - Comprehensive implementation plan with technical details, including:
- Current state analysis
- Requirements breakdown
- Technical design with code examples
- Phased implementation approach
- Testing and documentation strategy
- Risk assessment and mitigation

### Key Features
- **Job Creation and Management**: Create, retrieve, list, and delete jobs
- **Workflow Integration**: Instantiate workflows and validate inputs
- **Execution Control**: Start, stop, pause, and resume job execution
- **Cancellation System**: Graceful and forced termination with resource cleanup
- **Prioritization**: Priority levels, queue management, and resource allocation

## Dependencies

### Required Components
- Workflow Schema Definition (Issue #30)
- ComponentRegistry Class (Issue #28)

### Related Components
- Job Execution Engine (Issue #34)
- Job State Management (Issue #37)

## Implementation Timeline
The implementation is planned to be completed in 13 days (story points), divided into 5 phases:
1. Core Job Management Structure (Days 1-3)
2. Workflow Integration (Days 4-6)
3. Execution Control (Days 7-9)
4. Cancellation System (Days 10-11)
5. Prioritization (Days 12-13)

## Development Metrics
- Traditional development estimate: 13 days
- AI-assisted development estimate: 6 days
- Time savings: 7 days (54% reduction)
- Development velocity improvement: 2.17x faster
