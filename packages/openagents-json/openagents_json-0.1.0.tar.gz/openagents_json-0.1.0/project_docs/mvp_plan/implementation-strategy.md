# OpenAgents JSON: Implementation Strategy

This document provides a comprehensive implementation strategy for the OpenAgents JSON project, outlining the phased approach, key milestones, resource allocation, and success metrics.

## Project Overview

OpenAgents JSON is a FastAPI extension for building AI agent workflows that enables the composition of AI components into complex workflows. The project is designed around a three-stage model:

1. **Agent & Asset Definition** - Defining the building blocks of the system
2. **Workflow Definition** - Composing agents into reusable workflows
3. **Job Management** - Executing, monitoring, and managing workflow instances

This structured approach ensures clear separation of concerns and provides a logical progression from component definition to workflow execution.

## Three-Stage Model

### Stage 1: Agent & Asset Definition

The first stage focuses on defining and registering the building blocks of the system:

- **Agents**: AI components with specific capabilities
- **Tools**: Function-based components for specific tasks
- **Assets**: Shared resources that can be used across components
- **Capabilities**: Specific functions that agents can perform

Example agent definition:

```python
from openagents_json import OpenAgentsApp

agents_app = OpenAgentsApp()

@agents_app.agent("text_processor")
class TextProcessor:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.model = config.get("model", "gpt-3.5-turbo")
        
    @agents_app.capability("summarize")
    async def summarize(self, text: str, max_length: int = 100) -> str:
        """Summarize text to the specified length."""
        # Implementation
        return summarized_text
```

### Stage 2: Workflow Definition

The second stage enables the composition of agents and tools into workflows:

- **Workflow Schema**: JSON structure defining steps and connections
- **Workflow Validation**: Ensuring workflows are valid and executable
- **Workflow Templates**: Reusable patterns for common workflows
- **Workflow Versioning**: Managing changes to workflow definitions

Example workflow definition:

```python
agents_app.register_workflow({
    "id": "document-processing",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Process documents with branching logic",
    "steps": [
        {
            "id": "extract-text",
            "component": "document_processor.extract_text",
            "inputs": {"document": "{{input.document}}"}
        },
        {
            "id": "analyze-sentiment",
            "component": "text_analyzer.sentiment",
            "inputs": {"text": "{{extract-text.output}}"},
            "condition": "{{extract-text.success}}"
        }
    ],
    "output": {
        "sentiment": "{{analyze-sentiment.output}}",
        "status": "{{workflow.status}}"
    }
})
```

### Stage 3: Job Management

The third stage focuses on execution, monitoring, and management of workflow instances as jobs:

- **Execution Engine**: Running jobs with state management
- **Monitoring & Control**: Tracking progress and controlling execution
- **History & Analytics**: Recording execution history and performance metrics

Example job management:

```python
# Create and run a job
job = await agents_app.create_job(
    workflow_id="document-processing",
    inputs={"document": "https://example.com/doc.pdf"}
)

# Monitor job status
status = await agents_app.get_job_status(job.id)

# Get job results when complete
if status.state == "COMPLETED":
    results = await agents_app.get_job_results(job.id)
```

#### Execution Control Architecture

The execution control system provides robust mechanisms for handling job failures and distributing workloads across multiple workers:

##### Retry Policy System

The retry policy architecture follows a flexible and extensible design:

- **Abstract Base Class**: `RetryPolicy` defines the interface with abstract methods:
  - `get_retry_delay(attempt, max_retries)`: Calculates delay for a specific retry attempt
  - `to_dict()`: Serializes policy to dictionary for storage
  - `from_dict(data)`: Factory method for recreating policies from storage

- **Concrete Implementations**:
  - `FixedDelayRetryPolicy`: Consistent delay between retries with optional jitter
  - `ExponentialBackoffRetryPolicy`: Exponentially increasing delays with bounds and jitter

- **Serialization Strategy**: Policies serialize to dictionaries with a "type" field for dynamic reconstruction

This approach allows for unlimited custom retry strategies while maintaining storage compatibility.

##### Distributed Execution Model

The distributed execution system uses a shared-storage architecture for coordination:

- **Worker Process Model**:
  - Independent worker processes share a common job store
  - No direct worker-to-worker communication (stateless design)
  - Horizontal scaling with minimal coordination overhead

- **Job Claiming System**:
  - Optimistic concurrency for job assignment
  - Tag-based routing for worker specialization
  - Batched claiming to reduce database load

- **Failure Detection and Recovery**:
  - Heartbeat mechanism with configurable timeouts
  - Dead worker detection and job reassignment
  - Job state preservation during worker failures

- **Execution Architecture**:
  - Individual workers support concurrent job execution
  - Customizable executor functions for flexible processing
  - Resource-aware job claiming with configurable limits

This architecture allows for horizontal scaling across multiple machines without requiring complex orchestration infrastructure.

Example job execution control configurations:

```python
# Retry policy configuration
from openagents_json.job import Job, ExponentialBackoffRetryPolicy

# Create job with retry policy for resilience
job = Job(
    name="External API Integration",
    payload={"endpoint": "https://api.example.com/data"},
    max_retries=5,
    retry_policy=ExponentialBackoffRetryPolicy(
        initial_delay=1,    # Start with 1 second
        max_delay=60,       # Cap at 1 minute
        multiplier=2,       # Double delay each time
        jitter=0.2          # Add 20% randomness
    )
)

# Distributed execution configuration
from openagents_json.job import JobManager, SQLAlchemyJobStore, Worker, WorkerManager

# Create shared database job store
job_store = SQLAlchemyJobStore(
    dialect="postgresql",
    host="db.example.com",
    database="jobs_db"
)

# Configure manager for distributed execution
manager = JobManager(
    job_store=job_store,
    distributed_mode=True
)

# Start worker manager for failure detection
worker_manager = WorkerManager(
    job_store=job_store,
    heartbeat_timeout=120
)
await worker_manager.start()

# Start specialized workers
image_worker = Worker(
    job_store=job_store,
    tags=["image-processing"],
    max_concurrent_jobs=2  # Resource-intensive
)
await image_worker.start()

text_worker = Worker(
    job_store=job_store,
    tags=["text-processing"],
    max_concurrent_jobs=10  # Less resource-intensive
)
await text_worker.start()
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Architectural Decisions

1. **Event-Based Architecture**: We implemented an event-based system as the foundation for monitoring and observability. This provides loose coupling between components and allows for easy extension.

2. **Global Event Emitter**: A global event emitter instance provides a centralized point for event emission and subscription, simplifying the API while maintaining flexibility.

3. **Metrics Collection Categories**: We separated metrics collection into three distinct categories:
   - Job metrics (execution times, success rates, etc.)
   - Worker metrics (heartbeats, job claims, status)
   - System metrics (queue depth, event counts, uptime)

4. **REST API for Access**: A FastAPI-based REST API provides standardized access to all monitoring data, enabling integration with external tools and dashboards.

5. **In-Memory Storage**: Current implementation uses in-memory storage for metrics data, with a design that allows for future extension to persistent storage.

### Implementation Details

1. **Event System**:
   - Synchronous and asynchronous event handlers
   - Event queueing to prevent recursion issues
   - Type-safe event emission and handling
   - Comprehensive event types covering job lifecycle, worker activity, and system events

2. **Metrics Collection**:
   - Thread-safe metrics collection with locking
   - Categorized metrics for better organization
   - Historical job execution tracking
   - Worker status and heartbeat monitoring
   - System-wide health indicators

3. **REST API**:
   - Documented endpoints with query parameters
   - Status code standardization
   - Error handling and meaningful error messages
   - CORS support for frontend integrations

4. **Integration**:
   - JobManager integration through event emission
   - Worker integration for distributed monitoring
   - Example demonstrating event handlers and monitoring

### Future Extensions

1. **Persistent Metrics Storage**: Add database backends for long-term metrics storage and historical analysis.

2. **Visualization Dashboard**: Create a web-based dashboard for real-time monitoring visualization.

3. **Alerting System**: Implement configurable alerts based on metrics thresholds.

4. **External Tool Integration**: Add connectors for popular monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana.

5. **Distributed Event Bus**: Consider implementing a distributed event bus for multi-node deployments.

These architectural decisions and implementation details ensure that the OpenAgents JSON framework has a solid foundation for monitoring and observability, with clear paths for future enhancements.

        ├── middleware.py # Middleware integration
        └── routers/    # Router integration
```

### Configuration Management

The project implements a centralized settings management approach using Pydantic Settings v2:

1. **Environment Variables**: All configuration is available through environment variables with the `OPENAGENTS_` prefix
2. **`.env` File Support**: Environment variables can be loaded from a `.env` file
3. **`.env.example` File**: A template configuration file is provided for easy setup
4. **Typed Settings**: All settings are strongly typed with validation using Pydantic
5. **Centralized Access**: All components access settings through a single `settings` instance
6. **Security**: Sensitive values like API keys are handled securely using `SecretStr`
7. **Documentation**: All settings include descriptions and validation rules
8. **Profiles**: Support for different configuration profiles (development, testing, production)

Example `.env.example` file:

```
# OpenAgents JSON Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and modify as needed

# Application settings
OPENAGENTS_DEBUG=false
OPENAGENTS_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
OPENAGENTS_SECRET_KEY=change_this_to_a_secure_random_string

# Agent settings
OPENAGENTS_DEFAULT_LLM_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAGENTS_OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAGENTS_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=

# Job management settings
OPENAGENTS_JOB_RETENTION_DAYS=30
OPENAGENTS_MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS=100

# Storage settings
OPENAGENTS_STORAGE_TYPE=memory  # Options: memory, redis, postgres
OPENAGENTS_REDIS_URL=
OPENAGENTS_DATABASE_URL=
```

Example settings usage:

```python
from openagents_json.settings import settings

# Access settings in a type-safe way
if settings.debug:
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Use API keys securely
api_key = settings.openai_api_key.get_secret_value() if settings.openai_api_key else None

# Configure storage backend based on settings
if settings.storage_type == "redis":
    storage = RedisStorage(settings.redis_url)
elif settings.storage_type == "postgres":
    storage = PostgresStorage(settings.database_url)
else:
    storage = MemoryStorage()
```

### Versioning Strategy

The project will use semantic versioning (SemVer):

- **Major version (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes that require code modifications
- **Minor version (0.X.0)**: New features in a backward-compatible manner
- **Patch version (0.0.X)**: Backward-compatible bug fixes

During the MVP and Essential Workflow Engine phases, versions will be < 1.0.0, indicating the API is not yet stable.

### Distribution Approach

1. **Alpha phase (0.1.x)**:
   - Initial PyPI distribution with "alpha" tag
   - Implementation of all three stages with basic functionality
   - Limited documentation for early adopters

2. **Beta phase (0.5.x)**:
   - More stable PyPI distribution with "beta" tag
   - Enhanced implementation of all three stages
   - Comprehensive documentation and examples

3. **Release phase (1.0.0)**:
   - Stable public release
   - Complete implementation of all three stages
   - API stability guarantees and migration paths

### PyPI Distribution Workflow

The project will use GitHub Actions for automated testing and publishing:

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Automated testing on pull requests
   - Version bumping on merge to main branch
   - PyPI publishing on tagged releases

2. **Documentation**:
   - ReadTheDocs integration
   - Automatically updated from main branch
   - Version-specific documentation

## FastAPI Integration Approach

OpenAgents JSON will integrate with FastAPI applications in three primary ways:

1. **Extension Integration**:
   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   from openagents_json import OpenAgentsApp
   
   app = FastAPI()
   agents_app = OpenAgentsApp()
   
   # Stage 1: Register agents and tools
   @agents_app.tool("echo")
   def echo(message: str) -> str:
       return message
   
   # Stage 2: Register workflows
   agents_app.register_workflow({...})
   
   # Include in FastAPI app (provides Stage 3 endpoints)
   agents_app.include_in_app(app, prefix="/agents")
   ```

2. **Middleware Integration**:
   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   from openagents_json.fastapi.middleware import WorkflowMiddleware
   
   app = FastAPI()
   app.add_middleware(
       WorkflowMiddleware,
       component_registry_path="/components",  # Stage 1
       workflow_registry_path="/workflows",    # Stage 2
       job_manager_path="/jobs"               # Stage 3
   )
   ```

3. **Router Integration**:
   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   from openagents_json.fastapi.routers import agents_router, workflows_router, jobs_router
   
   app = FastAPI()
   app.include_router(agents_router, prefix="/agents")      # Stage 1
   app.include_router(workflows_router, prefix="/workflows") # Stage 2
   app.include_router(jobs_router, prefix="/jobs")          # Stage 3
   ```
