# OpenAgents JSON: Implementation Plan Index

This document serves as an index to the detailed implementation plan for the OpenAgents JSON project. The plan is structured as a phased approach, with each phase building upon the previous to create a robust, scalable, and developer-friendly FastAPI extension for AI agent workflows, distributed via PyPI.

## Three-Stage Model

The OpenAgents JSON framework is built around a three-stage model:

1. **Stage 1: Agent & Asset Definition** - Define and register AI components like agents, tools, and assets
2. **Stage 2: Workflow Definition** - Compose agents into reusable workflows with validation and templating
3. **Stage 3: Job Management** - Execute, monitor, and control workflow instances as jobs

Each implementation phase enhances all three stages, adding features and capabilities while maintaining a consistent conceptual model.

## Three-Stage Integration Methods

OpenAgents JSON integrates with FastAPI applications in three primary ways, each addressing all three stages:

### Extension Integration

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from openagents_json import OpenAgentsApp

app = FastAPI()
agents_app = OpenAgentsApp()

# Stage 1: Register agents and tools
@agents_app.agent("text_processor")
class TextProcessor:
    @agents_app.capability("summarize")
    async def summarize(self, text: str) -> str:
        return summarized_text

# Stage 2: Register workflows
agents_app.register_workflow({
    "id": "text-processing",
    "steps": [
        {
            "id": "summarize",
            "component": "text_processor.summarize",
            "inputs": {"text": "{{input.text}}"}
        }
    ],
    "output": "{{summarize.output}}"
})

# Include in FastAPI app (provides Stage 3 endpoints)
agents_app.include_in_app(app, prefix="/agents")

# Stage 3: Access job management via endpoints
# POST /agents/jobs - Create a new job
# GET /agents/jobs/{job_id} - Get job status
# GET /agents/jobs/{job_id}/results - Get job results
```

### Middleware Integration

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from openagents_json.fastapi.middleware import WorkflowMiddleware

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(
    WorkflowMiddleware,
    component_registry_path="/components",  # Stage 1
    workflow_registry_path="/workflows",    # Stage 2
    job_manager_path="/jobs"               # Stage 3
)
```

### Router Integration

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from openagents_json.fastapi.routers import agents_router, workflows_router, jobs_router

app = FastAPI()
app.include_router(agents_router, prefix="/agents")      # Stage 1
app.include_router(workflows_router, prefix="/workflows") # Stage 2
app.include_router(jobs_router, prefix="/jobs")          # Stage 3
```

## Directory Structure

The package follows a directory structure that reflects the three-stage model:

```

    ├── extension.py    # Extension integration
    ├── middleware.py   # Middleware integration
    └── routers/        # Router integration
```

## How to Use This Plan

1. Start with the [Executive Summary](executive-summary.md) for a high-level overview
2. Review the [Implementation Strategy](implementation-strategy.md) for a comprehensive understanding
3. For each phase, first read the overview document (README.md) to understand the goals and components
4. Use the checklist document for each phase to track implementation progress
5. Refer to the three-stage model as a consistent framework throughout implementation

## Next Steps

1. Review and refine the implementation plan with stakeholders
2. Assemble the development team for the MVP phase
3. Set up the development environment and infrastructure
4. Begin implementation of the MVP phase with the three-stage model
