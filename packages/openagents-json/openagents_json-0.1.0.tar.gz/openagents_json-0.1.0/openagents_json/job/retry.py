"""
Retry policy implementations for the OpenAgents JSON framework.

This module provides different retry strategies for failed jobs, including:
- Fixed delay: Retry with a constant delay between attempts
- Exponential backoff: Retry with increasing delays between attempts
- Jitter: Add randomness to retry delays to avoid thundering herd problems

These policies can be used to configure resilient job execution with
appropriate error handling for different types of failures.
