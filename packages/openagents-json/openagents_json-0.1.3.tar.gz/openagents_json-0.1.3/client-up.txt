**Below is a consolidated `next_steps.txt` plan with a combined checklist, merging the refined MVP recommendations **and** the goal for an automatically generated (Swagger-compatible) API experience—without including any sample code.**  

---

## next_steps.txt

### 1. **Introduce Basic Workflow Validation**

- **Action**: Create a dedicated validation module or function (e.g., `workflow_validation`) that inspects each workflow’s fields (`id`, `steps`, references to agents/tools) before execution.  
- **Success Metric**: If the workflow is invalid, respond with a clear error (e.g., `400 Bad Request`) in the FastAPI endpoint.

---

### 2. **Add Minimal Retry Logic for Workflow Steps**

- **Action**: Provide an optional `max_retries` parameter for each step. If a step fails, retry up to the specified limit.  
- **Success Metric**: Demonstrate partial resilience to transient failures without introducing overly complex orchestration.

---

### 3. **Standardize FastAPI API with Pydantic Models & Consistent Errors**

- **Action**:  
  - Use Pydantic schemas for input and output objects (e.g., `WorkflowCreate`, `JobCreate`).  
  - Maintain a uniform error response structure (e.g., `{ "error": "ErrorName", "detail": "Error details here" }`).  
- **Success Metric**: All routes produce well-defined OpenAPI docs with consistent error formats.

---

### 4. **Expand Basic Test Coverage: Unit & Integration**

- **Action**:  
  - Create unit tests (for agents, job manager, workflow logic) in a `tests/unit/` folder.  
  - Implement integration tests in a `tests/integration/` folder, calling your FastAPI endpoints with a `TestClient`.  
- **Success Metric**: Automatic tests verify that a workflow can be registered, run, and produce expected outcomes.

---

### 5. **(Optional) CLI Stub**

- **Action**: If time allows, implement a minimal CLI command (e.g., validating a workflow) that internally calls your FastAPI routes.  
- **Success Metric**: Provide basic convenience for local testing. Not essential if your main priority is the FastAPI extension.

---

### 6. **Establish a Simple CI Pipeline**

- **Action**:  
  - Use GitHub Actions (or another CI) to run `pytest` automatically.  
  - (Optional) Track coverage with a coverage tool, enforcing coverage thresholds.  
- **Success Metric**: PRs and commits trigger tests, preventing regressions or unverified code from merging.

---

### 7. **Ensure Swagger-Compatible Auto-Documentation**

- **Action**:  
  - For each route, define Pydantic request/response models and docstrings.  
  - Let FastAPI’s built-in `/docs` (Swagger) and `/redoc` auto-generate the UI.  
  - Add route-level metadata (like `summary` and `description`) for clarity.  
- **Success Metric**: All endpoints appear in `/docs` with clear parameters, JSON schemas, and error formats—minimal manual overhead.

## Checklist

1. **Workflow Validation**  
   - [ ] Implement a validation module.  
   - [ ] Return `400` if the workflow fails validation.  

2. **Retry Logic**  
   - [ ] Add `max_retries` in step definitions.  
   - [ ] Track attempt counts to prevent infinite loops.  

3. **API & Model Consistency**  
   - [ ] Replace ad-hoc dicts with Pydantic models (input/output).  
   - [ ] Standardize error responses.  

4. **Unit & Integration Tests**  
   - [ ] Write core unit tests for agents, job manager, validation.  
   - [ ] Write integration tests calling FastAPI endpoints.  

5. **(Optional) CLI Stub**  
   - [ ] Decide if a CLI is needed for local testing.  
   - [ ] If so, create a minimal command (e.g., `openagents test`).  

6. **Set Up CI**  
   - [ ] Configure GitHub Actions to run tests.  
   - [ ] (Optional) Enforce coverage thresholds.  

7. **Swagger-Generated Documentation**  
   - [ ] Use Pydantic schemas thoroughly.  
   - [ ] Provide route docstrings and metadata.  
   - [ ] Verify endpoints in `/docs` or `/redoc`.  

By following these seven steps—and using the above checklist—you’ll uphold a **simple, stable** FastAPI extension with reduced risk of runtime errors, thorough test coverage, and automatically generated docs that other developers can easily consume.
