# OpenAgents JSON - Agent Implementation Plan

## Overview
Based on the review of the codebase, the agent directory needs to be developed to support the core functionality of defining and managing AI agents within the OpenAgents JSON framework. The agent module will be responsible for providing interfaces, base classes, and utilities for creating, configuring, and registering agents with capabilities and tools.

## Current Status
- ✅ The agent directory structure has been created with all necessary files
- ✅ Core functionality for agent registration and capabilities is implemented
- ✅ Base agent classes and interfaces are implemented
- ✅ Capability and tool management is implemented
- ✅ Configuration and monitoring systems are implemented
- ✅ Workflow integration is implemented
- ✅ Utility functions for state management, validation, and serialization are implemented
- ✅ Example implementations are provided

## Implementation Plan (Completed)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Core Agent Interfaces) ✅

1. **Base Agent Classes** ✅
   - Created `base.py` with abstract base classes for different agent types
   - Defined `BaseAgent` interface with core methods like `initialize`, `execute`, `validate`
   - Implemented agent lifecycle management (setup, teardown)

2. **Agent Types** ✅
   - Implemented `LLMAgent` for language model-based agents
   - Implemented `ToolAgent` for agents that primarily orchestrate tools
   - Implemented `WorkflowAgent` for agents that execute defined workflows

3. **Core Agent Functionality** ✅
   - Implemented state management for agents
   - Added support for agent memory/context
   - Created utility functions for agent logging and tracing

### Phase 2: Capabilities and Tools Integration ✅

1. **Capability Management** ✅
   - Created `capabilities.py` with base classes and utilities for capabilities
   - Implemented capability resolution and dependency injection
   - Added validation for capability inputs/outputs

2. **Tool Integration** ✅
   - Implemented `tools.py` with utilities for tool integration
   - Created standard tool interfaces
   - Added tool discovery and registration

3. **Decorator Examples** ✅
   - Populated `decorator_examples` directory with practical examples
   - Created examples for basic agent, LLM agent, and tool agent
   - Demonstrated capability and tool integration

### Phase 3: Advanced Features ✅

1. **Agent Chain Management** ✅
   - Implemented support for chaining agents together
   - Added routing logic between agents
   - Created utilities for managing agent state across chains

2. **Agent Configuration** ✅
   - Added support for agent configuration via JSON/YAML
   - Implemented configuration validation
   - Created configuration templates

3. **Agent Monitoring** ✅
   - Added telemetry and monitoring support
   - Implemented logging and tracing
   - Created debugging utilities

### Phase 4: Integration with Workflow System ✅

1. **Workflow Integration** ✅
   - Connected agents to the workflow system
   - Implemented agent execution as workflow steps
   - Added utilities for converting agents to workflow steps

2. **Job Management** ✅
   - Added support for agent execution as jobs
   - Implemented job status tracking
   - Created utilities for job management

3. **API Integration** ✅
   - Connected agents to the API system
   - Implemented agent-specific endpoints
   - Added documentation for agent API
