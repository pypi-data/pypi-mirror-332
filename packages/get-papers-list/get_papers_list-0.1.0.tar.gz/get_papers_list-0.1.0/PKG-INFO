## **How the Code is Organized**

The program is organized into the following components:

### 1. **`get_papers.py`**

   - Contains functions for:
     - **Fetching Paper IDs**: `fetch_paper_ids()`
     - **Fetching Paper Details**: `fetch_paper_details()`
     - **Checking Pharmaceutical/Biotech Affiliations**: `is_pharma_biotech()`
     - **Extracting Emails**: `extract_email()`

### 2. **Command-Line Interface**
   - The program is executed via the command line using `poetry run get-papers-list`.
   - Supports the following options:
     - `query`: The PubMed query to search for papers.
     - `-d` or `--debug`: Enables debug mode.
     - `-f` or `--file`: Saves the results to a CSV file.

### 3. **Dependencies**
