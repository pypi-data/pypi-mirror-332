    """BlobPath modeling a file which is always relative to a root directory that is injected using implicit variables.

    Properties:  
        * Globally Unique: False  

    The path is simply composed of ``relpath``, a ``pathlib.PurePath`` which is the relative path from the root directory  

    Usage:

    .. code-block:: python

        relpath = PurePath("hello") / "world.txt"
        p = LocalRelativeBlobPath(relpath)
        with p.open("r") as f:
           print(f.read())

    The path object is a really simple wrapper around ``pathlib.PurePath`` and ``pathlib.Path``.  
    The main use-case of this is to provide an API compatible with other storages.  
    This would enable you to seamlessly use your current FS to do file operations.  

    The path uses an implicit variable ``IMPLICIT_BLOB_PATH_LOCAL_RELATIVE_BASE_DIR`` which injects the root directory to use for these paths. This variable is required to be present if you want to use this path  
    Injecting this variable makes this path a bit more flexible for using between different processes.  

    * Two docker containers mounting the same volume at different mount points can transparently point to file paths correctly by simply changing their ``IMPLICIT_BLOB_PATH_LOCAL_RELATIVE_BASE_DIR`` variables  
    * Same for two servers mounted on an NFS  

    Providing relative paths like this makes it easy to access file paths across different processes assuming they can access the file system. There is also a footgun here though, you need to make sure that the environment is correctly configured for every process using this path. In terms of the concepts of ``BlobPath``, this path is not "Globally Unique"
