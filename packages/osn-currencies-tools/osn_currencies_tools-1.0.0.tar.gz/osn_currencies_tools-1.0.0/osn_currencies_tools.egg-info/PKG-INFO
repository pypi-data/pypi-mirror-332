# osn-currencies-tools: A Python Library for Currency Exchange

osn-currencies-tools provides a set of tools for fetching and converting currency exchange rates. It includes functionalities to retrieve live exchange rates from currencylive.com and exchangerate-api.com, as well as via the Open Exchange Rates API.  The library handles currency conversion and provides exception handling for invalid currency codes and failed API requests.

## Key Features:

*   **Multiple Exchange Rate Sources:** Supports fetching exchange rates from currencylive.com, exchangerate-api.com, and Open Exchange Rates API.
*   **Currency Conversion:**  Allows easy conversion between different currencies.
*   **Error Handling:** Provides custom exceptions for handling invalid currency codes and API errors.
*   **Currency Tag Validation:** Validates currency tags against a predefined list.
*   **Simple API:** Offers a clean and intuitive API for currency exchange operations.

## Installation:

* **With pip:**
    ```bash
    pip install osn-currencies-tools
    ```

* **With git:**
    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/oddshellnick/osn-currencies-tools.git
    ```

## API Reference:

*   **currency_live:**  Fetches live exchange rates from currencylive.com.
    *   `get_exchange_rate(from_currency_tag: str, to_currency_tag: str) -> float`: Retrieves the exchange rate between two currencies.
    *   `exchange_currency(currency_amount: float, from_currency_tag: str, to_currency_tag: str) -> float`:  Converts an amount from one currency to another.

*   **exchange_rate:** Fetches exchange rates from exchangerate-api.com.
    *   `get_exchange_rate(api_key: str, from_currency_tag: str, to_currency_tag: str) -> float`: Retrieves the exchange rate between two currencies.
    *   `exchange_currency(api_key: str, currency_amount: float, from_currency_tag: str, to_currency_tag: str) -> float`:  Converts an amount from one currency to another.

*   **open_exchange_rates:** Fetches exchange rates from Open Exchange Rates API.
    *   `get_exchange_rate(app_id: str, from_currency_tag: str, to_currency_tag: str) -> float`: Retrieves the exchange rate between two currencies.
    *   `exchange_currency(app_id: str, currency_amount: float, from_currency_tag: str, to_currency_tag: str) -> float`:  Converts an amount from one currency to another.

    *   `CurrencyTagNotFoundError`: Raised when a currency abbreviation is not found.

## Usage Examples:

**Using currencylive.com:**

```python
from osn_currencies_tools.currency_live import get_exchange_rate, exchange_currency

try:
    rate = get_exchange_rate("USD", "EUR")
    print(f"Exchange rate USD to EUR: {rate}")

    converted_amount = exchange_currency(100, "USD", "EUR")
    print(f"100 USD in EUR: {converted_amount}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

**Using exchangerate-api.com:**

```python
from osn_currencies_tools.exchange_rate import get_exchange_rate, exchange_currency

api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"  # Replace with your actual API key

try:
    rate = get_exchange_rate(api_key, "USD", "EUR")
    print(f"Exchange rate USD to EUR: {rate}")

    converted_amount = exchange_currency(api_key, 100, "USD", "EUR")
    print(f"100 USD in EUR: {converted_amount}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

**Using Open Exchange Rates API:**

```python
from osn_currencies_tools.open_exchange_rates import get_exchange_rate, exchange_currency

app_id = "YOUR_APP_ID"  # Replace with your actual App ID

try:
    rate = get_exchange_rate(app_id, "USD", "EUR")
    print(f"Exchange rate USD to EUR: {rate}")

    converted_amount = exchange_currency(app_id, 100, "USD", "EUR")
    print(f"100 USD in EUR: {converted_amount}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```


## Future Notes:

osn-currencies-tools is under active development. Planned future enhancements include support for more exchange rate APIs and caching of exchange rates to reduce API calls. Contributions and suggestions for new features are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests on the project's repository.
