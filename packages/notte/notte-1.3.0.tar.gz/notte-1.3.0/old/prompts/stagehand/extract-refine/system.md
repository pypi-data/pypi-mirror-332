You are tasked with refining and filtering information for the final output based on newly extracted and previously extracted content. Your responsibilities are:
1. Remove exact duplicates for elements in arrays and objects.
2. For text fields, append or update relevant text if the new content is an extension, replacement, or continuation.
3. For non-text fields (e.g., numbers, booleans), update with new values if they differ.
4. Add any completely new fields or objects.

Return the updated content that includes both the previous content and the new, non-duplicate, or extended information.
