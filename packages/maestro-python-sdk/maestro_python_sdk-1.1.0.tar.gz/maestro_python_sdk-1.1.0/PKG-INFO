                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Requirements
> Python 3.10 required

# Installation

> First of all you need to install m3-python-sdk to your project, you can use next command to do it:
- `pip install maestro-python-sdk`

> After you installed maestro-python-sdk to your project, you should set ENV variables,
> this step is optional, because you would be able to pass those params while creating instances, but we highly recommend you to do this, because it will make your use more pleasant and flexible, and also such a method is more secure.
 - SDK_ACCESS_KEY,
 - SDK_SECRET_KEY,
 - MAESTRO_USER,
> This is first required variables you should set, the following variables depend on the way you will be using the SDK.
 
### `Rabbit`
 - RABBIT_EXCHANGE, 
 - DEFAULT_MAESTRO_REQUEST_QUEUE, DEFAULT_MAESTRO_RESPONSE_QUEUE, 
 - DEFAULT_ADMIN_REQUEST_QUEUE, DEFAULT_ADMIN_RESPONSE_QUEUE,
 - DEFAULT_KPI_REQUEST_QUEUE, DEFAULT_KPI_RESPONSE_QUEUE  
### `HTTP`
 - API_LINK


# USAGE

To start using Maestro Python SDK you need to create either an HTTP client or a RabbitMQ client. The difference between them is not significant. If you need to send asynchronous requests, use only the RabbitMQ client, as it is the only one that supports such functionality. In other cases, use whichever is more convenient for you.

## RabbiMQ

**There are two ways to create RabbitMQ client:**

+ Create client using ```__init__``` method of a RabbitMqStrategy class:
+ Create client using ```build``` method of a RabbitMqStrategy class:

### ```__init__``` method Example
>Step 1: Create a RabbitMqStrategy object. This step requires the following information: rabbit connection url for maestro server, your personal sdk access and secret keys, maestro user and names of rabbit queues, more information about parameters is described inside RabbitMqStrategy class. Below is an example of how to create a client:
1. ```python 
   from m3_python_sdk.strategies.rabbitmq import RabbitMqStrategy
   rabbit_client = RabbitMqStrategy(
        connection_url='<connection url>',
        request_queue='<request_queue>',
        response_queue='<response_queue>',
        sdk_access_key='<sdk_access_key>',
        sdk_secret_key='<sdk_secret_key>',
        maestro_user='<maestro_user>'
   )
   # For your information, request/response queues, sdk keys and maestro user
   # could be set as ENV varibles, if you dont provide them while creating class,
   # they would be searched in env variables automatically.

>Step 2: If you provided sdk with correct credentials and parameters you are good to go to use SDK. An examples is provided in the "Examples" topic.

### ```BUILD``` method Example
>Step 1: Create a RabbitMqStrategy object. This step requires the following information: host, username and password, stage, amqps and everything that takes basic __init__ method. Below is an example of how to create a client:
1. ```python 
   rabbit_client = RabbitMqStrategy(
        host='<host123.eu.amazon>',
        stage='<mstrdev>',
        username='<username>',
        password='<password>',
        request_queue='<request_queue>',
        response_queue='<response_queue>',
        sdk_access_key='<sdk_access_key>',
        sdk_secret_key='<sdk_secret_key>',
        maestro_user='<maestro_user>'
   )
   
   #as result you will get next rabbit_url:  
    'amqps://username:password@host123.eu.amazon:5671/mstrdev'
   
   # For your information, request/response queues, sdk keys and maestro user'
   # could be set as ENV varibles, if you dont provide them while creating class,
   # they would be searched in env variables automatically.


> Step 2: If you provided sdk with correct credentials and parameters you are good to go to use SDK. An examples is provided in the "Examples" topic.
> Now that you have created the client, you can use it to interact with the SDK. An example is provided in the "Examples" topic.


## HTTP

**There are two ways to create HTTP client:**

+ Create client using ```__init__``` method of a HTTPStrategy class:
+ Create client using ```build``` method of a HTTPStrategy class:

### ```__init__``` method Example
>Step 1: Create a HTTPStrategy object. This step requires the following information: api_link for maestro server, your personal sdk access and secret keys and maestro user, more information about parameters is described inside HTTPStrategy class. Below is an example of how to create a client:
1. ```python 
   from m3_python_sdk.strategies.http import HTTPStrategy
   http_client = HTTPStrategy(
        api_link='<api link>',
        sdk_access_key='<sdk_access_key>',
        sdk_secret_key='<sdk_secret_key>',
        maestro_user='<maestro_user>'
   )
   # For your information, sdk keys and maestro user could be set as ENV varibles,
   # if you dont provide them while creating class,
   # they would be searched in env variables automatically.
   # Namings for ENV variables:

>Step 2: If you provided sdk with correct credentials and parameters you are good to go to use SDK. An examples is provided in the "Examples" topic.

### ```BUILD``` method Example
>Step 1: Create a HTTPStrategy object. This step requires the following information: host, port, stage, htpps, and everything that takes basic __init__ method except api_link. Below is an example of how to create a client:
1. ```python 
   http_client = HTTPStrategy(
        host='<m3.cloud.com>',
        stage='<maestro/api/v3>',
        port='8000',
        https='True',
        sdk_access_key='<sdk_access_key>',
        sdk_secret_key='<sdk_secret_key>',
        maestro_user='<maestro_user>'
   )
   
   #as result you will get next api_link:  
    https://m3.cloud.com:8000/maestro/api/v3
   
   # For your information, request/response queues, sdk keys and maestro user'
   # could be set as ENV varibles, if you dont provide them while creating class,
   # they would be searched in env variables automatically.
   # SDK_ACCESS_KEY, SDK_SECRET_KEY, MAESTRO_USER, API_LINK

> Step 2: If you provided sdk with correct credentials and parameters you are good to go to use SDK. An examples is provided in the "Examples" topic.
> Now that you have created the client, you can use it to interact with the SDK. An example is provided in the "Examples" topic.
> 
## EXAMPLES

> When you create a basic HTTP ot RabbitMQ clients using one of provided ways, you can use it to call some methods.
>
> In general, methods are separated into next categories:
> - Consumptions
>   - add_consumption
>   - get_consumption
>   - delete_consumption
>   - add_consumption_details
>   - get_consumption_details
>   - delete_consumption_details
>   - check_tenant_status
> - Adjustments
>   - add_adjustment
>   - get_adjustment
>   - delete_adjustment
>   - total_report
> - Billing
>   - describe_billing_month
>   - describe_currency
>   - get_top_account_reports
>   - add_cost_center
>   - archive_big_query
>   - billing_configure


> Here are examples of how to call one method from each category.

> 1. ```python
>    # You need to create Http ot Rabbit client, after that create ConsumptionResource class object and pass your client inside init method
>    from m3_python_sdk.strategies.http import HttpStrategy
>    from m3_python_sdk.resources.consumption.consumption import ConsumptionResource
>    http = HttpStrategy(#the example is given above.)
>    consumption = ConsumptionResource(client=http)
>    consumption.get_consumption(
>           source_project='example',
>           target_project='example',
>           target_region='example',
>           year=example,
>           month=example,
>           description='example'
>    )
>    
>    response: {'status_code': status_code, 'status': status, 'message': message}
>    # Remember that response could also have next params: data, items, table_title, warnings, code

> 2. ```python
>    # You need to create Http ot Rabbit client, after that create AdjustmentResource class object and pass your client inside init method
>    from m3_python_sdk.strategies.rabbitmq import RabbitMqStrategy
>    from m3_python_sdk.resources.consumption.adjustment import AdjustmentResource
>    rabbit = RabbitMqStrategy(#the example is given above.)
>    adjustment = AdjustmentResource(client=rabbit)
>    adjustment.get_adjustment(
>           target_project='example',
>           target_account_number='example',
>           target_region='example',
>           #target_cloud='example',
>           month='example',
>           year='example',
>           description='example',
>           credit_type='example',
>           currency_native='example',
>           value='example'
>    )
>    
>    response: {'status_code': status_code, 'status': status, 'message': message}
>    # Remember that response could also have next params: data, items, table_title, warnings, code
