To use this module, you need to go to a relational field related to the lot model. For example:

1. Go to Stock / Overview
2. Edit the "Receipts" operation type to use existing lots ("Use existing ones")
3. Create a new incoming picking, for example in Inventory / Operation / Receipts
4. In the operations, add a product with tracking by lots.
5. Mark the picking as todo if not already done.
6. Open the stock move for the added product
7. You can search lots by reference typing it under "Lot/Serial Number"
8. If you add a lot with reference, the reference will also be shown in the lot name
