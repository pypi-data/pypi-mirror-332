SSAT is a Python package implementing statistical models for sports analytics. The package provides a collection of frequentist and Bayesian statistical models for analyzing and predicting sports match outcomes.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Statistical Models**:
  - Frequentist Models:
    - Bradley-Terry Model: Paired comparison model for team rankings
    - TOOR (Team Offense-Offense Rating): Offensive performance analysis
    - GSSD (Goal Scoring Statistical Distribution): Goal distribution modeling
    - ZSD (Zero-Score Distribution): Special case handling for 0-0 outcomes
    - PRP (Possession-based Rating Process): Team rating based on possession metrics
    - Poisson Model: Classic goal-scoring probability distribution
  - Bayesian Models:
    - Bayesian Poisson: Probabilistic goal-scoring model with team attack/defense capabilities
    - Negative Binomial: Overdispersed goal-scoring model for higher variance
    - Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial: Handles excess zeros in low-scoring matches
    - Skellam: Direct modeling of goal differences
    - Zero-Inflated Skellam: Enhanced modeling of draws and low-scoring games

- **Data Processing**: Integrated with flashscore-scraper for automated data collection
- **Visualization**: Comprehensive plotting utilities for model analysis
- **Model Comparison**: Tools for comparing predictions across different models

## Installation

```bash
pip install ssat
```

For full functionality including all optional dependencies:
```bash
pip install ssat[all]
```

### Dependencies

- Core: numpy, pandas, scipy
- Optional:
  - Development: ipykernel, ipywidgets, jupyter
  - Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
  - Data Collection: flashscore-scraper, requests, beautifulsoup4
  - Machine Learning: scikit-learn, statsmodels
  - Bayesian (planned): arviz, cmdstanpy

## Quick Start

```python
import pandas as pd
from ssat.frequentist import BradleyTerry, Poisson

# Load data
df = pd.read_pickle("ssat/data/sample_handball_data.pkl")
X = df[["home_team", "away_team"]]
Z = df[["home_goals", "away_goals"]]
y = df["spread"]

# Initialize and fit models
bt_model = BradleyTerry()
poisson_model = Poisson()

# Fit models
bt_model.fit(X, y, Z)
poisson_model.fit(X, y, Z)

# Make predictions
bt_predictions = bt_model.predict(X)
poisson_predictions = poisson_model.predict(X)

# Predict probabilities
bt_probas = bt_model.predict_proba(X, Z, point_spread=0, include_draw=True)
poisson_probas = poisson_model.predict_proba(X, Z, point_spread=0, include_draw=True)
```

## Bayesian Models

SSAT's Bayesian models provide probabilistic predictions with uncertainty quantification. These models use MCMC sampling via Stan to estimate team strengths and predict match outcomes.

### Available Models

1. **Bayesian Poisson**
   ```python
   from ssat.bayesian import Poisson

   model = Poisson()
   model.fit(X)  # X contains [home_team, away_team, home_goals, away_goals]

   # Make predictions
   predictions = model.predict(new_matches)
   probabilities = model.predict_proba(new_matches, point_spread=0)

   # Visualize team strengths
   model.plot_team_stats()
   ```

2. **Negative Binomial**
   ```python
   from ssat.bayesian import NegBinom

   model = NegBinom()
   model.fit(X)
   ```
   Better suited for matches with higher scoring variance.

3. **Zero-Inflated Models**
   ```python
   from ssat.bayesian import NegBinomZero, SkellamZero

   model = NegBinomZero()  # or SkellamZero()
   model.fit(X)
   ```
   Specifically designed for competitions with frequent low scores or draws.

### Model Features

- **Uncertainty Quantification**: All predictions include credible intervals
- **Team Statistics**: Analyze attack and defense capabilities per team
- **Visualization Tools**:
  ```python
  # View MCMC diagnostics
  model.plot_trace()

  # Analyze team strengths
  model.plot_team_stats()
  ```
- **Flexible Predictions**:
  - Win/Draw/Loss probabilities
  - Expected goals
  - Custom point spread predictions

### Example Usage

```python
import pandas as pd
from ssat.bayesian import Poisson

# Load match data
matches = pd.DataFrame({
    'home_team': ['TeamA', 'TeamB', ...],
    'away_team': ['TeamB', 'TeamC', ...],
    'home_goals': [2, 1, ...],
    'away_goals': [1, 2, ...]
})

# Initialize and fit model
model = Poisson()
model.fit(matches)

# Predict new matches
new_matches = pd.DataFrame({
    'home_team': ['TeamA'],
    'away_team': ['TeamC']
})

# Get win probabilities
probs = model.predict_proba(new_matches)
print(f"Win probability: {probs[0]:.2%}")

# Analyze team strengths
model.plot_team_stats()
```

## Data Sources

Match data is collected using the [flashscore-scraper](https://github.com/flashscore/flashscore-scraper) package. The package includes sample handball data in `ssat/data/sample_handball_data.pkl` for testing and examples.

## API Documentation

### Base Model
All models inherit from `BaseModel` providing common functionality:
- `fit(X, y, Z)`: Fit the model to training data
- `predict(X)`: Predict match outcomes
- `predict_proba(X, Z, point_spread, include_draw)`: Predict outcome probabilities

### Specific Models

#### Bradley-Terry Model
```python
from ssat.frequentist import BradleyTerry

model = BradleyTerry()
model.fit(X, y, Z)
```
Implements paired comparison modeling for team strength estimation.

#### Poisson Model
```python
from ssat.frequentist import Poisson

model = Poisson()
model.fit(X, y, Z)
```
Models goal-scoring as a Poisson process.
