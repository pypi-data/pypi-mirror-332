# Hi, I'm Vishva Allen. Reqv is a Python library designed to help you scrape data from modern websites and web applications,
#  especially those that rely heavily on JavaScript frameworks like React. Reqv connects to the APIs that websites use to retrieve data in JSON format, 
# making it easier to extract the information you need without worrying about rendering JavaScript.
