# Reqv - Python Library

Hi, I'm Vishva Allen. Reqv is a Python library designed to help you scrape data from modern websites and web applications, especially those that rely heavily on JavaScript frameworks like React. Reqv connects to the APIs that websites use to retrieve data in JSON format, making it easier to extract the information you need without worrying about rendering JavaScript. 


## Under Construction
