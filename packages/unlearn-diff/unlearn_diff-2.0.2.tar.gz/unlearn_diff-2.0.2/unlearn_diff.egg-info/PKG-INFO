# Unlearn Diff

Unlearn Diff is an open-source Python package designed to streamline the development of unlearning algorithms and establish a standardized evaluation pipeline for diffusion models. It provides researchers and practitioners with tools to implement, evaluate, and extend unlearning algorithms effectively.

### [**Documentation**](https://ramailotech.github.io/msu_unlearningalgorithm/)
You can find the full documentation for this project at the url given below.
https://ramailotech.github.io/msu_unlearningalgorithm/
## Features

- **Comprehensive Algorithm Support**: Includes commonly used concept erasing and machine unlearning algorithms tailored for diffusion models. Each algorithm is encapsulated and standardized in terms of input-output formats.

- **Automated Evaluation**: Supports automatic evaluation on datasets like UnlearnCanvas or IP2P. Performs standard and adversarial evaluations, outputting metrics as detailed in UnlearnCanvas and UnlearnDiffAtk.

- **Extensibility**: Designed for easy integration of new unlearning algorithms, attack methods, defense mechanisms, and datasets with minimal modifications.

## Usage
This section contains the usage guide for the package.

### Installation

#### Prerequisities
Ensure `conda` is installed on your system. You can install Miniconda or Anaconda:

- **Miniconda** (recommended): [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- **Anaconda**: [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

After installing `conda`, ensure it is available in your PATH by running. You may require to restart the terminal session:

Before installing the unlearn_diff package, follow these steps to set up your environment correctly. These instructions ensure compatibility with the required dependencies, including Python, PyTorch, and ONNX Runtime.


**Step-by-Step Setup:**

1. Create a Conda Environment Create a new Conda environment named myenv with Python 3.8.5:

```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.8.5
```

2. Activate the Environment Activate the environment to work within it:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

3. Install Core Dependencies Install PyTorch, torchvision, CUDA Toolkit, and ONNX Runtime with specific versions:

```bash
conda install pytorch==1.11.0 torchvision==0.12.0 cudatoolkit=11.3 onnxruntime==1.16.3 -c pytorch -c conda-forge
```

4. Install our unlearn_diff Package using pip:

```bash
pip install unlearn_diff
```

5. Install Additional Git Dependencies:

 After installing unlearn_diff, install the following Git-based dependencies in the same Conda environment to ensure full functionality:
