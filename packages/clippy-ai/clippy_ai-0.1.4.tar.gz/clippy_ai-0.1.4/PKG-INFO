The first time you run the tool you will be prompted to configure it. You will need to provide your OpenAI API key. You can do that by running the ```clippy configure``` command. 

```bash
clippy configure
```

### Functions

Currently the tool has the following functions:

- `ai`: Send a prompt to OpenAI and get a response
- `cmd`: Send a prompt to OpenAI and get a response that executes a command
- `configure`: Configure the OpenAI API key
- `time`: Track time spent on a task

## AI Assistant

The `ai` command allows you to send prompts directly to OpenAI and get responses:

```bash
clippy ai "What is the capital of France?"
```

## Command Execution

The `cmd` command allows you to send prompts to OpenAI and get a response that executes a command:

```bash
clippy cmd "List all files in the current directory"
```

## Time Tracking

Time tracking can be configured to use TMetric and/or Harvest Tools. 

The `time` command allows you to track time spent on a task:

```bash
clippy time -p "Development task, worked from 9-11 today"
```
