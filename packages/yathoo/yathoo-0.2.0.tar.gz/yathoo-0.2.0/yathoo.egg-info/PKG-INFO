# Yathoo

`Yathoo` is a Python package designed for encoding, decoding, and cloaking files. It provides functions to encode text into a unique format, decode it back, and manage cloaked files for secure storage.

## Installation

You can install Yathoo using `pip`:

```bash
pip install yathoo
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the `yathoo` package:

```python
from yathoo import yathoo

# Example of encoding a string
encoded_string = yathoo.encode("Hello, world!")
print(f"Encoded: {encoded_string}")

# Example of decoding the string back
decoded_string = yathoo.decode(encoded_string)
print(f"Decoded: {decoded_string}")
```

### Cloaking Example:

IMP: You compulsorily need to use the function init_cloaker() before you encode or decode
     DO NOT DELETE yathoo_cloaker DIRECTORY AFTER CLOAKING OR YOU MAY LOSE FILES! SAFELY DECLOAK THEM! DATE AND TIME
     OF CREATION OF FILES ALTERS WITH THE CLOAK-DECLOAK PROCESS BUT NOT THE DATA LOCATION AND NAME!

```python
# Example of cloaking a file
file_id = yathoo.cloak("path/to/your/file.txt")
print(f"File cloaked with ID: {file_id}")

# Example of decloaking the file
yathoo.decloak(file_id)
print("File decloaked successfully.")
```
