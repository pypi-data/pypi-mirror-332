# RPyUtils

[![Imports: isort](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20imports-isort-%231674b1?style=flat&labelColor=ef8336)](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)

Frequent python functions that I use and practice for package release to PyPI.

See [Docs](www.example.com) for details.

# Installation

```bash
pip install -U ...
```

## Not Priority

- [Implementing an Interface in Python](https://realpython.com/python-interface/): it is talking about api interface.

## Notes

- When you run a package with `-m`, the file `__main__.py` within the package is executed.
- Adding & removing files to & from the source distribution is done by writing a `MANIFEST.in` file at the project root.
- According to PEP 8, comments should have a maximum length of 72 characters.

## Contributing

The repo uses [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) for code formatting.  
Run the following to install the hooks using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).

```bash
