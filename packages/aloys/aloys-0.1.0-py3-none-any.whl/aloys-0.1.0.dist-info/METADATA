## Ingredients

- 1 and 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 and 1/2 cups granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup whole milk
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup boiling water

## Instructions

1. **Preheat Oven**: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round baking pans.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

3. **Add Wet Ingredients**: Add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla to the flour mixture and beat on medium speed until well combined.

4. **Add Boiling Water**: Reduce the mixer speed to low and carefully add the boiling water to the cake batter. Beat on high speed for about 1 minute to add air to the batter.

5. **Bake**: Distribute the cake batter evenly between the prepared baking pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

6. **Cool**: Remove from the oven and allow the cakes to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then remove from the pans and cool completely on a wire rack.

7. **Frost**: Once the cakes are completely cool, frost with your favorite chocolate frosting.

Enjoy your homemade chocolate cake!

  - For a richer chocolate flavor, use dark cocoa powder.
  - For a moister cake, add a dollop of sour cream to the batter.
