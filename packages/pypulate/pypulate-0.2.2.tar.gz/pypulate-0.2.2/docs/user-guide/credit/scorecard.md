# Credit Scorecard

The `create_scorecard` function implements a points-based credit scoring system, which is one of the most widely used approaches in the credit industry. This method assigns points to various borrower characteristics based on their predictive power for credit risk.

## What is a Credit Scorecard?

A credit scorecard is a statistical model that:
- Assigns points to different borrower characteristics
- Combines these points into a total score
- Categorizes applicants into risk segments based on their score
- Provides transparency and interpretability in credit decisions



Where:
- $x_i$ is the value of feature $i$
- $\text{offset}_i$ is the reference point for feature $i$
- $\text{weight}_i$ is the importance of feature $i$
- $\text{scaling factor}$ adjusts the point scale

## Usage in Pypulate

```python
from pypulate.credit import create_scorecard

# Define applicant features
features = {
    "age": 35,
    "income": 75000,
    "credit_history": 0.8,
    "debt_ratio": 0.3,
    "payment_history": 0.95
}

# Define feature weights (importance)
weights = {
    "age": 0.5,
    "income": 0.3,
    "credit_history": 2.0,
    "debt_ratio": -1.5,
    "payment_history": 1.8
}

# Define offsets (reference points)
offsets = {
    "age": 25,
    "income": 50000,
    "credit_history": 0.5,
    "debt_ratio": 0.4,
    "payment_history": 0.7
}

# Create the scorecard
result = create_scorecard(
    features=features,
    weights=weights,
    offsets=offsets,
    scaling_factor=100.0,
    base_score=600
)

# Access the results
total_score = result["total_score"]
risk_category = result["risk_category"]
points_breakdown = result["points_breakdown"]
thresholds = result["thresholds"]  # Dynamic thresholds based on scaling factor
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `features` | dict | Dictionary of feature names and values | Required |
| `weights` | dict | Dictionary of feature names and weights | Required |
| `offsets` | dict | Dictionary of feature names and reference points | {} |
| `scaling_factor` | float | Controls the range of points | 100.0 |
| `base_score` | float | Starting point for the score calculation | 600 |

## Return Value

The function returns a dictionary with the following keys:

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `total_score` | float | The calculated credit score |
| `risk_category` | str | Categorization based on the score |
| `points_breakdown` | dict | Dictionary showing points contributed by each feature |
| `thresholds` | dict | Dictionary of the adjusted thresholds used for risk categorization |

The `points_breakdown` dictionary includes:
- One key for each feature in the input `features` dictionary
- The value is the points contributed by that feature to the total score

The `thresholds` dictionary includes:
- `excellent`: Threshold for "Excellent" risk category
- `good`: Threshold for "Good" risk category
- `fair`: Threshold for "Fair" risk category
- `poor`: Threshold for "Poor" risk category

## Risk Level Classification

The credit score is categorized into risk levels (using reference thresholds for scaling_factor=100.0):

| Credit Score Range | Risk Level |
|-------------------|------------|
| â‰¥ 750 | Excellent |
| 700 - 749 | Good |
| 650 - 699 | Fair |
| 600 - 649 | Poor |
| < 600 | Very Poor |

The thresholds are dynamically adjusted based on the scaling factor:

- Reference thresholds (for scaling_factor=100.0):
  - Excellent: 750
  - Good: 700
  - Fair: 650
  - Poor: 600

- For different scaling factors, the thresholds are adjusted using:
  ```
  adjusted_threshold = base_score + (reference_threshold - base_score) * (reference_scaling / scaling_factor)
  ```

This formula ensures that:
- With a smaller scaling factor (e.g., 20.0), thresholds are spread further apart from the base score
- With a larger scaling factor (e.g., 500.0), thresholds are compressed closer to the base score

This dynamic adjustment ensures that risk categories remain meaningful regardless of the scaling factor used.

## Comprehensive Example

Here's a complete example demonstrating how to create and use a credit scorecard for multiple applicants with different scaling factors:

```python
from pypulate.credit import create_scorecard

    "credit_history": 0.3,      # Poor credit record
    "debt_ratio": 0.6,          # High debt
    "payment_history": 0.5      # Frequent late payments
}

fair_applicant = {

    "debt_ratio": 0.15,         # Low debt
    "payment_history": 0.95     # Nearly perfect payment record
}

# Define feature weights (importance)

    "debt_ratio": -1.5,         # Strong negative impact
    "payment_history": 1.8      # Strong positive impact
}

# Define offsets (reference points)

## How Points Are Calculated

Let's break down the calculation for the fair applicant with scaling_factor=100.0:

1. **Age**: (40 - 25) Ã— 0.5 / 100.0 = 0.075 points
    - 15 years above reference age
    - Moderate positive weight (0.5)
    - Divided by scaling factor (100.0)
    - Results in 0.075 additional points

2. **Income**: (70000 - 50000) Ã— 0.3 / 100.0 = 60.0 points
    - $20,000 above reference income
    - Moderate positive weight (0.3)
    - Divided by scaling factor (100.0)
    - Results in 60.0 additional points

3. **Credit History**: (0.75 - 0.5) Ã— 2.0 / 100.0 = 0.5 points
    - 0.25 above reference credit history
    - Strong positive weight (2.0)
    - Divided by scaling factor (100.0)
    - Results in 0.5 additional points

4. **Debt Ratio**: (0.3 - 0.4) Ã— -1.5 / 100.0 = 0.15 points
    - 0.1 below reference debt ratio
    - Strong negative weight (-1.5)
    - Divided by scaling factor (100.0)
    - Being below reference with negative weight results in positive points
    - Results in 0.15 additional points

5. **Payment History**: (0.85 - 0.7) Ã— 1.8 / 100.0 = 0.27 points
    - 0.15 above reference payment history
    - Strong positive weight (1.8)
    - Divided by scaling factor (100.0)
    - Results in 0.27 additional points

6. **Base Score**: 600 points

7. **Total Score**: 600 + 0.075 + 60.0 + 0.5 + 0.15 + 0.27 = 660.995 points

8. **Risk Category**: Fair (between 650 and 700)
    - The thresholds are dynamically adjusted based on the scaling factor
    - For scaling_factor=100.0, the thresholds are:
        - Excellent: 750
        - Good: 700
        - Fair: 650
        - Poor: 600

## Impact of Scaling Factor

The scaling factor significantly impacts the range of scores:

1. **Small Scaling Factor (e.g., 20.0)**:
    - Creates wider score ranges
    - Points have more impact on the total score
    - Thresholds are spread further from the base score

2. **Large Scaling Factor (e.g., 500.0)**:
    - Creates narrower score ranges
    - Points have less impact on the total score
    - Thresholds are compressed closer to the base score

3. **Standard Scaling Factor (100.0)**:
    - Provides a balanced approach
    - Points have moderate impact on the total score
    - Thresholds are at standard intervals from the base score

The dynamic threshold adjustment ensures that risk categories remain meaningful regardless of the scaling factor used.

## Benefits of the Scorecard Approach

1. **Transparency**: Clear relationship between applicant characteristics and score
2. **Customizability**: Weights and offsets can be adjusted based on business needs
3. **Interpretability**: Easy to explain why an applicant received a particular score
4. **Consistency**: Standardized approach to evaluating creditworthiness
5. **Flexibility**: Can be applied to various lending contexts (mortgages, auto loans, credit cards)

## Practical Applications

The scorecard approach can be used for:

1. **Consumer Lending**: Evaluating loan applications
2. **Credit Card Approvals**: Determining credit limits and interest rates
3. **Mortgage Underwriting**: Assessing mortgage applicants
4. **Small Business Lending**: Evaluating business loan applications
5. **Tenant Screening**: Assessing potential renters

## Best Practices

1. **Feature Selection**: Choose features with strong predictive power
2. **Weight Calibration**: Derive weights from statistical analysis of historical data
3. **Offset Selection**: Set offsets based on population averages or policy considerations
4. **Regular Validation**: Periodically validate the scorecard against actual outcomes
5. **Compliance Checks**: Ensure the scorecard complies with fair lending regulations
