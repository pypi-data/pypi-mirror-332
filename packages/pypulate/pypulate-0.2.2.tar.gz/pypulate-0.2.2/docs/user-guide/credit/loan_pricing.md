# Loan Pricing

The `loan_pricing` function implements a risk-based loan pricing model that calculates the appropriate interest rate for a loan based on various risk factors and cost components. This model helps lenders determine fair and profitable loan terms while accounting for the borrower's risk profile.

## Components of Loan Pricing

The loan pricing model considers several key components:

1. **Expected Loss Component**: Accounts for the probability of default and the expected loss given default
2. **Funding Cost Component**: Reflects the lender's cost of obtaining funds
3. **Operating Cost Component**: Covers the administrative costs of originating and servicing the loan
4. **Capital Cost Component**: Accounts for the required return on the capital allocated to support the loan

## Usage in Pypulate

```python
from pypulate.credit import loan_pricing

# Calculate risk-based loan pricing
result = loan_pricing(
    loan_amount=100000,           # $100,000 loan
    term=5,                       # 5-year term
    pd=0.02,                      # 2% annual probability of default
    lgd=0.4,                      # 40% loss given default
    funding_cost=0.03,            # 3% cost of funds
    operating_cost=0.01,          # 1% operating costs
    capital_requirement=0.08,     # 8% capital requirement
    target_roe=0.15               # 15% target return on equity
)

# Access the results
recommended_rate = result["recommended_rate"]
monthly_payment = result["monthly_payment"]
components = result["components"]
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `loan_amount` | float | The principal amount of the loan | Required |
| `term` | float | The loan term in years | Required |
| `pd` | float | Probability of default (annual rate, between 0 and 1) | Required |
| `lgd` | float | Loss given default (as a decimal, between 0 and 1) | Required |
| `funding_cost` | float | Cost of funds (annual rate) | Required |
| `operating_cost` | float | Operating costs as percentage of loan amount | Required |
| `capital_requirement` | float | Capital requirement as percentage of loan amount | Required |
| `target_roe` | float | Target return on equity (annual rate) | Required |

## Return Value

The function returns a dictionary with the following keys:

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `recommended_rate` | float | The calculated interest rate for the loan |
| `effective_annual_rate` | float | The effective annual rate (APR) |
| `monthly_payment` | float | The calculated monthly payment amount |
| `total_interest` | float | Total interest paid over the life of the loan |
| `expected_profit` | float | Expected profit after accounting for losses and costs |
| `return_on_investment` | float | Expected return on the allocated capital |
| `components` | dict | Dictionary containing the individual pricing components |

The `components` dictionary includes:
- `expected_loss`: Component accounting for credit risk
- `funding_cost`: Component accounting for cost of funds
- `operating_cost`: Component accounting for operational expenses
- `capital_cost`: Component accounting for capital allocation
- `risk_premium`: Combined risk-related components (expected_loss + capital_cost)

## Risk Level Classification

The loan risk is categorized based on the expected loss rate (PD Ã— LGD):

| Expected Loss Rate Range | Risk Level |
|--------------------------|------------|
| < 1% | Very Low |
| 1% - 3% | Low |
| 3% - 7% | Moderate |
| 7% - 15% | High |
| > 15% | Very High |

## Pricing Component Analysis

Each component of the loan pricing model serves a specific purpose:

1. **Expected Loss Component** (pd Ã— lgd / term)
    - Compensates for the expected credit losses
    - Directly proportional to both probability of default and loss severity
    - Higher risk borrowers have significantly higher expected loss components

2. **Funding Cost Component**
    - Represents the lender's cost of obtaining the funds to lend
    - Typically based on market interest rates
    - Generally consistent across borrowers regardless of risk

3. **Operating Cost Component** (operating_cost / term)
    - Covers origination, servicing, and administrative costs
    - Spread over the life of the loan
    - May vary slightly based on loan complexity

4. **Capital Cost Component** (capital_requirement Ã— target_roe)
    - Compensates for the opportunity cost of capital allocated to the loan
    - Higher risk loans may require more capital allocation
    - Reflects the lender's required return on invested capital

5. **Risk Premium** (expected_loss + capital_cost)
    - The combined risk-related components
    - Represents the additional return required to compensate for risk
    - Primary differentiator in pricing between low and high-risk borrowers

## Practical Applications

Risk-based loan pricing can be used for:

1. **Consumer Lending**: Setting appropriate rates for personal loans, auto loans, and mortgages
2. **Commercial Lending**: Pricing business loans based on company financial health
3. **Credit Card Pricing**: Determining APRs for different customer segments
4. **Loan Portfolio Management**: Ensuring adequate returns across a portfolio of loans
5. **Competitive Analysis**: Benchmarking pricing against market competitors

## Limitations and Considerations

When using risk-based loan pricing, consider these limitations:

1. **Model Assumptions**: The accuracy depends on reliable estimates of PD and LGD
2. **Market Constraints**: Competitive pressures may limit the ability to charge risk-appropriate rates
3. **Regulatory Considerations**: Fair lending laws may restrict risk-based pricing in some markets
4. **Customer Acceptance**: Very high rates may lead to adverse selection or reduced demand
5. **Economic Cycles**: Risk parameters should be adjusted for changing economic conditions
