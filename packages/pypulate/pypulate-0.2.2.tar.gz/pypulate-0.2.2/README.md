## üöÄ Installation

```bash
pip install pypulate
```

## üîß Quick Start

### Technical Analysis
```python
from pypulate import Parray

# Create a price array
prices = Parray([10, 11, 12, 11, 10, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 11])

# Technical Analysis with method chaining
result = (prices
    .sma(3)                    # Simple Moving Average
    .ema(3)                    # Exponential Moving Average
    .rsi(7)                    # Relative Strength Index
)

# Signal Detection
golden_cross = prices.sma(5).crossover(prices.sma(10))
```

### Business KPIs
```python
from pypulate import KPI

kpi = KPI()

# Calculate Customer Metrics
churn = kpi.churn_rate(
    customers_start=1000,
    customers_end=950,
    new_customers=50
)

# Get Business Health
health = kpi.health
print(f"Business Health Score: {health['overall_score']}")
```

### Portfolio Analysis
```python
from pypulate import Portfolio

portfolio = Portfolio()

# Calculate Returns and Risk
returns = portfolio.simple_return([100, 102, 105], [102, 105, 108])
sharpe = portfolio.sharpe_ratio(returns, risk_free_rate=0.02)
var = portfolio.value_at_risk(returns, confidence_level=0.95)

# Get Portfolio Health
health = portfolio.health
print(f"Portfolio Health: {health['status']}")
```

### Portfolio Allocation
```python
from pypulate import Allocation
import numpy as np

allocation = Allocation()

# Sample returns data (252 days, 5 assets)
returns = np.random.normal(0.0001, 0.02, (252, 5))
risk_free_rate = 0.04

# Mean-Variance Optimization
weights, ret, risk = allocation.mean_variance(
    returns, 
    risk_free_rate=risk_free_rate
)
print(f"Mean-Variance Portfolio:")
print(f"Expected Return: {ret:.2%}")
print(f"Risk: {risk:.2%}")

# Risk Parity Portfolio
weights, ret, risk = allocation.risk_parity(returns)

# Kelly Criterion (with half-Kelly)
weights, ret, risk = allocation.kelly_criterion(
    returns, 
    kelly_fraction=0.5
)

# Black-Litterman with views
views = {0: 0.15, 1: 0.12}  # Views on first two assets
view_confidences = {0: 0.8, 1: 0.7}
market_caps = np.array([1000, 800, 600, 400, 200])
weights, ret, risk = allocation.black_litterman(
    returns, market_caps, views, view_confidences
)
```

### Service Pricing
```python
from pypulate import ServicePricing

pricing = ServicePricing()

# Calculate Tiered Price
price = pricing.calculate_tiered_price(
    usage_units=1500,
    tiers={
        "0-1000": 0.10,
        "1001-2000": 0.08,
        "2001+": 0.05
    }
)

# Calculate Subscription Price
sub_price = pricing.calculate_subscription_price(
    base_price=99.99,
    features=['premium', 'api_access'],
    feature_prices={'premium': 49.99, 'api_access': 29.99},
    duration_months=12,
    discount_rate=0.10
)
```

### Credit Scoring
```python
from pypulate.dtypes import CreditScoring

credit = CreditScoring()

# Corporate Credit Risk Assessment
z_score = credit.altman_z_score(
    working_capital=1200000,
    retained_earnings=1500000,
    ebit=800000,
    market_value_equity=5000000,
    sales=4500000,
    total_assets=6000000,
    total_liabilities=2500000
)
print(f"Altman Z-Score: {z_score['z_score']:.2f}")
print(f"Risk Assessment: {z_score['risk_assessment']}")

# Retail Credit Scoring
scorecard_result = credit.create_scorecard(
    features={
        "age": 35,
        "income": 75000,
        "years_employed": 5,
        "debt_to_income": 0.3
    },
    weights={
        "age": 2.5,
        "income": 3.2,
        "years_employed": 4.0,
        "debt_to_income": -5.5
    }
)
print(f"Credit Score: {scorecard_result['total_score']:.0f}")
print(f"Risk Category: {scorecard_result['risk_category']}")

# Expected Credit Loss
ecl = credit.expected_credit_loss(
    pd=0.05,  # Probability of default
    lgd=0.4,  # Loss given default
    ead=100000  # Exposure at default
)
print(f"Expected Credit Loss: ${ecl['ecl']:.2f}")
```
