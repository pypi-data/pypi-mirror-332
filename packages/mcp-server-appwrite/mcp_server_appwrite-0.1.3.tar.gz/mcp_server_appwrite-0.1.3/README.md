Currently, the server supports the following tools:

- [x] Databases
- [x] Users

> Please note that adding a lot of tools exceeds the context window of the LLM. As a result, we will make available a curated list of tools that are most commonly used.

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the directory you're running the server from:

```env
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-api-key
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=your-endpoint  # Optional, defaults to https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
```
> Note: Ensure that your API Key has the necessary scopes to access the resources you want to use.

## Installation

### Using uv (recommended)
When using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) no specific installation is needed. We will
use [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to directly run *mcp-server-appwrite*.

```bash
uvx run mcp-server-appwrite
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install mcp-server-appwrite
```
Then run the server using 

```bash
python -m mcp_server_appwrite
```

## Usage with Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "appwrite": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": [
      "mcp-server-appwrite"
    ],
    "env": {
      "APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID": "your-project-id",
      "APPWRITE_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
      "APPWRITE_ENDPOINT": "your-endpoint"  // Optional
    }
  }
}
```
Upon successful configuration, you should be able to see the server in the list of available servers in Claude Desktop.

    "command": "uvx",
    "args": [
      "mcp-server-appwrite"
    ],
    "env": {
      "APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID": "your-project-id",
      "APPWRITE_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
      "APPWRITE_ENDPOINT": "your-endpoint"  // Optional
    }
  }
}
```

## Local Development

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/appwrite/mcp.git
```

Install `uv`

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Create virtual environment

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Run the server

```bash
uv run -v --directory ./ mcp-server-appwrite
```

## Debugging

You can use the MCP inspector to debug the server. 

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector \
  uv \
  --directory . \
  run mcp-server-appwrite
```

Make sure your `.env` file is properly configured before running the inspector. You can then access the inspector at `http://localhost:5173`.
