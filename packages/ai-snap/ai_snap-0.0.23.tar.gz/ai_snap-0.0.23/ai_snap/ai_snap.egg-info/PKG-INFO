By default, AI-Snap will scan all files and directories in the current folder and produce an output file called project_contents.txt.

## Example

Let's assume that we are going to improve some aspect of AI-snap with ChatGPT.

First of all, we need to create .ai-snap file in the project directory (or specify your own file with --config-file):

```
ai_snap/
!scripts
!.ai-snap
ai-snap
ai-snap.py
!LICENSE
!README.md
PipFile
pyproject.toml
```
