## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This repo is a lightweight fork of LlamaIndex's workflow module, offering powerful event-driven orchestration without the full llama-index-core dependencies. I love the work that LlamaIndex has done with their workflow module, and I wanted a lightweight version that I could use in my own projects without the overhead of the full llama-index-core module.
