# OniLock - Secure Password Manager CLI

OniLock is a command-line password manager that allows you to securely store, retrieve, and manage your passwords with ease. Designed for simplicity and security, OniLock offers encryption and clipboard integration to keep your credentials safe.


## 📖 Introduction
Most password managers focus on graphical interfaces, leaving terminal enthusiasts behind. Onilock changes that by offering a sleek, terminal-based user experience paired with a comprehensive set of command-line options.

It’s designed for those working without a graphical interface, users who need quick password access over SSH, or anyone who simply prefers the command line over traditional GUI tools.

With full support for command-line arguments, Onilock empowers users to create custom aliases and streamline password management to fit their unique workflows.


## 🚀 Features
- **Initialize a secure profile** using `onilock init`
- **Store new accounts** with `onilock new`
- **List stored accounts** using `onilock list`
- **Copy passwords to clipboard** securely with `onilock copy`
- **Remove accounts** using `onilock remove`
- **Generate strong passwords** with `onilock generate`
- **Shell completion support** for faster command-line usage


## 🛠 Installation

OniLock is best installed using `pipx` to keep it isolated:

1. **Install pipx**
```sh
sudo apt install pipx
```

2. **Install OniLock systemwide**

N.B. Make sure you don't have any active virtual environments before executing this command.

```sh
pipx install onilock
```


## ⚠️  Issues

If you encounter any issues with the `init` command, make sure the following dependancies are setup in your system:

1. **Ensure xclip and gpg are installed**. If not, run the following command
```sh
sudo apt install xclip gpg
```


## 📌 Usage
Once installed, you can use `onilock` directly from your terminal:

```sh
onilock --help
```

### 🔹 Initialize OniLock
Before using OniLock, initialize your profile:
```sh
onilock init
```

### 🔹 List Stored Accounts

## 🔒 Security
