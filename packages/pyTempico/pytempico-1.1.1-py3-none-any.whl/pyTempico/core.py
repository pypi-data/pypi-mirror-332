    To create an object of the TempicoDevice class, it is required to send as
    parameter the desired com_port. For example,
    
    >>> my_tempico_device_object = pyTempico.TempicoDevice('COM5')
    
    To modify or access attributes, **please use methods**. For example,
    
    >>> my_tempico_device_object.getIdn()
    
    To access attributes of a particular channel, use methods of the 
    TempicoChannel class through attributes ch1, ch2, ch3, ch4 of this class.
    For example, to get average cycles on channel 2,
    
    >>> my_tempico_device_object.ch2.getAverageCycles()
    
    Changing attributes without using methods, do not change the actual 
    parameters in the device.
    
    Accesing attributes without using methods, returns values registered in 
    local memory, that may not be updated.
    
    To begin a measurement and read its results, use methods 
    :func:`~pyTempico.core.TempicoDevice.measure` and 
    :func:`~pyTempico.core.TempicoDevice.fetch`.
