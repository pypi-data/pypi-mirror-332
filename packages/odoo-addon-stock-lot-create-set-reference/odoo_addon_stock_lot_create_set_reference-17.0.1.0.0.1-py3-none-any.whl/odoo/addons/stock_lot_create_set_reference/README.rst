This module allows you to generate lots from stock picking by manually
setting the value of the internal reference instead of the lot name.

Without this module, you create lots in the picking by filling its name,
with this module, you will create lots filling its internal reference
instead.

As the lot name is still a required field, it will be autogenerated
using lot sequences. The sequence will be the configured in the product
with the product_lot_sequence module, and if not set, the generated with
general product lot counter

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Go to Inventory / Configuration / Operation types. Mark the "Use
   Lots" and the "Set Name as Internal Reference" checks
2. Go to the readme of the product_lot_sequence module and configure a
   new sequence for the desired products.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Create a new incoming picking, for example in Inventory / Operation /
   Receipts
2. In the operations, add a product with tracking by lots.
3. Make sure the operation type of the picking has "Set Name as Internal
   Reference" as true.
4. Mark the picking as todo if not already done.
5. Open the stock move for the added product, and add the lot internal
   ref in the "Lot/Serial Number" Field
6. Validate the picking, and review the created lots. You will see the
   internal reference you set and the autogenerated lot name.
