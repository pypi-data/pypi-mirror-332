To use this module, you need to:

1. Create a new incoming picking, for example in Inventory / Operation / Receipts
2. In the operations, add a product with tracking by lots.
3. Make sure the operation type of the picking has "Set Name as Internal Reference" as true.
4. Mark the picking as todo if not already done.
5. Open the stock move for the added product, and add the lot internal ref in the "Lot/Serial Number" Field
6. Validate the picking, and review the created lots. You will see the internal reference you set and the autogenerated lot name.
