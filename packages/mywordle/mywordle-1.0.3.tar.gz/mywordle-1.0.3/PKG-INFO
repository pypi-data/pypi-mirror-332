# mywordle

mywordle is a library that brings the Wordle game to Python with customization.

Millions of people enjoy Wordle every day from the NYT.
However, people cannot access it on Python and it is very difficult to customize.
This library brings this game to Python and lets them put their own twist to it.

## Features

- Allows users to play Wordle
- Allows for wordbank customization
- Allows for multiple lengths
- Allows for guess amount changing
- Has a helpful keyboard color-coder

## Installation

To install mywordle, use pip: ```pip install mywordle```.

However, many prefer to use a virtual environment.

macOS / Linux:

```sh
# make your desired directory
mkdir /path/to/your/directory
cd /path/to/your/directory

# setup the .venv (or whatever you want to name it)
pip install virtualenv
python3 -m venv .venv

# install mywordle
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install mywordle

deactivate # when you are completely done
```

Windows CMD:

```sh
# make your desired directory
mkdir C:path\to\your\directory
cd C:path\to\your\directory

# setup the .venv (or whatever you want to name it)
pip install virtualenv
python3 -m venv .venv

# install mywordle
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install mywordle

deactivate # when you are completely done
```

## Information

Wordle is a game that is now owned by the NYT.
The aim is to guess a 5-letter word within 6 attempts.
When you guess the word, you will be given a color-coded result with the following key:

- Green is the correct letter in the correct spot
- Yellow is the correct letter but it is in a different spot
- Gray/White means that the letter is not in the word.

## Usage

This game aims to mimic Wordle with thousands of available words.
To use it is very simple! Simply run:

```python
from mywordle import Wordle

game = Wordle()

game.play()
```

Guesses/words are not case sensitive.

You may pass in a custom word to guess for but it must be 5 letters, just like guesses.

It also must be part of the ```guess_list```. This is a list of words that are valid guesses, while ```word_list``` is a list of words that are valid starting points.
Randomly generated words are from the latter, because they are more well known. However, if you want to use a custom target, it must be part of guess_list.

To check if a word falls into either, use ```is_valid_word``` or ```is_valid_guess```

This means that you can guess with ```xylyl``` but it won't ever appear unless if you use ```game.play('xylyl')```.

An intracacy to beware of is the color prioritization.
On the words, it will be easy to understand.
On the keyboard, it prioritizes green > yellow > grey > white.

See examples for more information on how to use the game.

## Customization

Wordle has many variants, and this library's distinction is customization. You may change the amount of guesses or change the word length.

You may alter ```num_guesses``` to be a different amount, like 7.
You may set ```allow_custom_words = True```.
This setting makes any alphabetic string a possible target word.

For example, if you want to have the word ```magazine```, guessed, you may do the following:

```python
game.play('magazine', num_guesses = 7, allow_custom_words = False)
```

You can input your own ```custom_word_list``` and/or ```custom_guess_list``` to further customize the game.

```custom_word_list```: This is a list of words from which the target word will be randomly selected. The words in this list can have varying lengths. When provided, the target word will be chosen from this list. If empty, any word can be chosen but a ```custom_word``` must be provided in ```play()```. ```custom_guess_list``` must also be an empty list if this is.
```custom_guess_list```: If ```custom_word_list``` is provided, this must include it. Otherwise, it serves as additional words that are valid guesses to the default. If an empty list, any guess is valid.

For example, if you have a list of your own words that you want to use, you can have the following:

```python
game = Wordle(['magazine', 'apples', 'oranges'], []) # allows any guesses after picking from this list
game = Wordle(['magazine', 'apples', 'oranges'], ['magazine', 'apples', 'oranges', ...]) # allows for a set guesslist that includes the word list

game.play()
```

Because though the word lengths may be different, the word length must be given away, which can be an indicator of what the word is.

Make sure that the player doesn't have access to the list or it is sufficiently large enough.
