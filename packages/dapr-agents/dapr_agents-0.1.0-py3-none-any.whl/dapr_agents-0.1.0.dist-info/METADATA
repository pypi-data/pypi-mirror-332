              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

> 🚧 Dapr Agents is in active development and evolving with ongoing research. APIs and core structures may change as the framework matures and Dapr integration is refined.

Dapr Agents is an open-source framework for researchers and developers to experiment with LLM-based autonomous agents. It provides tools to create, orchestrate, and manage agents while seamlessly connecting to LLM inference APIs. Built on [Dapr](https://docs.dapr.io/), Dapr Agents leverages a unified programming model that simplifies microservices and supports both deterministic workflows and event-driven interactions. Using Dapr’s Virtual Actor pattern, Dapr Agents enables agents to function as independent, self-contained units that process messages sequentially, eliminating concurrency concerns while seamlessly integrating into larger workflows. It also facilitates agent collaboration through Dapr’s Pub/Sub integration, where agents communicate via a shared message bus, simplifying the design of workflows where tasks are distributed efficiently, and agents work together to achieve shared goals. By bringing together these features, Dapr Agents provides a powerful way to explore agentic workflows and the components that enable multi-agent systems to collaborate and scale, all powered by Dapr.

## Documentation (WIP 🚧): https://github.com/dapr-sandbox/dapr-agents

## Why Dapr 🎩?

[Dapr](https://docs.dapr.io/) provides Dapr Agents with a unified programming model that simplifies the development of resilient and scalable systems by offering built-in APIs for features such as service invocation, Pub/Sub messaging, workflows, and even state management. These components, essential for defining agentic workflows, allow developers to focus on designing agents and workflows rather than rebuilding foundational features. By leveraging Dapr’s sidecar architecture and portable, event-driven runtime, Dapr Agents also enables agents to collaborate effectively, share tasks, and adapt dynamically across cloud and edge environments. This seamless integration brings together deterministic workflows and LLM-based decision-making into a unified system, making it easier to experiment with multi-agent systems and scalable agentic workflows.

### Key Dapr Features in Dapr Agents:
* 🎯 **Service-to-Service Invocation**: Facilitates direct communication between agents with built-in service discovery, error handling, and distributed tracing. Agents can leverage this for synchronous messaging in multi-agent workflows.
* ⚡️ **Publish and Subscribe**: Supports loosely coupled collaboration between agents through a shared message bus. This enables real-time, event-driven interactions critical for task distribution and coordination.
* 🔄 **Workflow API**: Defines long-running, persistent workflows that combine deterministic processes with LLM-based decision-making. Dapr Agents uses this to orchestrate complex multi-step agentic workflows seamlessly.
* 🧠 **State Management**: Provides a flexible key-value store for agents to retain context across interactions, ensuring continuity and adaptability during workflows.
* 🤖 **Actors**: Implements the Virtual Actor pattern, allowing agents to operate as self-contained, stateful units that handle messages sequentially. This eliminates concurrency concerns and enhances scalability in Dapr Agents's agent systems.

## Install Dapr Agents ⚡️

Make sure you have Python already installed. `Python >=3.9`

### As a Python package using Pip

```bash
pip install dapr-agents
```

### Remotely from GitHub

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/dapr-sandbox/dapr-agents.git
```

### From source with `poetry`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dapr-sandbox/dapr-agents

cd dapr-agents

poetry install
```

## Install Dapr

If you're using an IDE that supports devcontainers, you can use the devcontainer configuration in this repository to get started. This has Python & the Dapr CLI preinstalled, and will also initialize Dapr on startup.

If you're not using the devcontainer, follow the steps below to install the Dapr CLI.

### Install the Dapr CLI

Install the [Dapr CLI](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/) to manage Dapr-related tasks like running applications with sidecars, viewing logs, and launching the Dapr dashboard. It works seamlessly with both self-hosted and Kubernetes environments. For a complete step-by-step guide, visit the official [Dapr CLI installation page](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/).

Verify the CLI is installed by restarting your terminal/command prompt and running the following:

```bash
dapr -h
```

### Initialize Dapr in Local Mode

Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) already installed. I use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

Initialize Dapr locally to set up a self-hosted environment for development. This process installs Dapr sidecar binaries, runs essential services like Redis (state store and message broker) and Zipkin (observability), and prepares a default components folder. For detailed steps, see the official [guide on initializing Dapr locally](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-selfhost/).

To initialize the Dapr control plane containers and create a default configuration file, open an elevated terminal and run:

```bash
dapr init
```

Verify you have container instances with `daprio/dapr`, `openzipkin/zipkin`, and `redis` images running:

```bash
docker ps
```

## Development
To run the automated tests in the `quickstarts` directory you need to install the [Mechanical Markdown](https://github.com/dapr/mechanical-markdown) tool. This tool is used to run the code snippets in the markdown files and verify the output.
Once installed, you can validate all the quickstarts by running the following command:

```bash
make validate-quickstarts
```

To validate a single quickstart, navigate to the `quickstarts` directory and run the `validate.sh` script:

```bash
cd quickstarts
./validate 01-hello-world
```

## Contributing to the docs

### Running the docs locally

1. Install the dependencies

```bash
pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-material
pip install "mkdocs-material[imaging]"
pip install mkdocs-jupyter
```

2. Run the docs

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
