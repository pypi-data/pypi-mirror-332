  One of the two variable reaction-diffusion model presented in the article
  "Autocatalytic reactions in the isothermal, continuous stirred tank
  reactor: isolas and other forms of multistability".

  It describes the chemical reactions:
  U + 2V -> 3V
  V -> P

  u, v: concentrations of U, V.
  k: rate of conversion of V to P.
  f: rate of the process that feeds U and drains U, V, and P.
