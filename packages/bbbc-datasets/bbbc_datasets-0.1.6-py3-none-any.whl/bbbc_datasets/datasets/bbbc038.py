    BBBC038 Dataset: Kaggle 2018 Data Science Bowl - Nuclei Segmentation.

    - **Biological Application:**
      This dataset was created for the Kaggle 2018 Data Science Bowl to challenge segmentation algorithms
      in detecting and segmenting nuclei across a diverse range of biological contexts.
      The dataset includes thousands of images containing nuclei from various organisms, imaging techniques,
      and experimental conditions.

    - **Images:**
      - The dataset includes images from multiple sources, including human, mouse, and fly samples.
      - Nuclei appear in different contexts such as cultured monolayers, tissues, and embryos.
      - Imaging techniques include fluorescent and histology stains.
      - The dataset is divided into:
        - **Stage 1 Training Set:** Includes images and corresponding segmentation masks.
        - **Stage 1 Test Set:** Unlabeled images for testing.
        - **Stage 2 Test Set:** Additional test images, including conditions not present in Stage 1.

    - **Segmentations:**
      - Ground truth segmentation masks are provided for each nucleus separately.
      - Masks do not overlap (each pixel belongs to only one mask).
      - Labels and annotations available as CSV files.

    - **Metadata:**
      - Includes additional annotations and ground truth solutions for test sets.
