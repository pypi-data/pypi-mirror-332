def draw_fathers(partition, genetic=None, covariate = None, ndraws=10000, use_covariates=False, covariates_only=False):
    """
    Draws a sample of compatible fathers for each family in a single partition.
    Candidates are drawn proportional to their posterior probability of paternity.

    Optionally, a sample of candidates can be drawn at random, or proportional
    to some other distribution, such as a function of distance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    partition: list
        A 1-d array of integers labelling individuals into families. This should
        have as many elements as there are individuals in paternity_probs.
    genetic: numpy array
        2-D matrix listing information on paternity of individuals.
    covariate: array, optional
        1-d vector of log probabilities that each candidate is the sire of each
        full sibship in the partition. Probabilities are assumed to be the same
        for each partition. If values do not sum to one, they will be normalised
        to do so.
    ndraws: int
        Number of Monte Carlo draws for each family.
    use_covariates: boolean, optional
        If True, information on prbabilities associated with covariates stored
        in paternityArray objects are incorporated into weights for drawing likely
        fathers.
    covariates_only: boolean, optional
        If True, candidates are drawn based on covariate probabilities only 
        (i.e. ignoring genetic data)

    Returns
    -------
    A list of candidates compatible with the genetic data, and a second list of
    candidates drawn under random mating if specified.
